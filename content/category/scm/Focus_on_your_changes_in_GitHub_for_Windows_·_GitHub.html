<p>One of the things you'll notice when creating commits is the new, compact list of changed files in your working directory. </p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/634063/7920112/0f2085a0-089d-11e5-804b-d42eff5b5987.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/634063/7920112/0f2085a0-089d-11e5-804b-d42eff5b5987.png" alt="Dedicated view of your local changes"></a> </p>

<p>GitHub for Windows shows the number of files that a commit changed and lets you drill down to see what changed in a given file.</p>

<p>The updated branch selector now groups your recently used branches so that you can jump straight back in to what you were doing before that pesky hotfix distracted you.</p>

<p>We've given branch creation a dedicated place in the toolbar. As a bonus, you can pick which branch to base the new one off.</p>

<p>Finally, you can collapse the repository list to reclaim some screen space.</p>

<p>If you have GitHub for Windows installed it will automatically update to the latest version. If you don't have it installed, download GitHub for Windows from <a href="https://windows.github.com">windows.github.com</a>.</p>
