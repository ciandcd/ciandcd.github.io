                  <p>Last week we had to pull our 7.10.2 release as in a small number of installations
the migrations would fail because of a uniqueness constraint on tags. We
did not release GitLab 7.10.3, as we improved a migration after creating
the 7.10.3 version tag and wanted to include that in our patch release.</p>

<p>Today we release GitLab 7.10.4 which solves the issues with the migrations
and contains all fixes also present in 7.10.2. If you&#8217;ve already successfully
upgraded to 7.10.2, you do not need to update at this time.</p>

<p>The fixes in this patch:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix migrations broken in 7.10.2</li>
<li>Add missing indices to tags for some installations</li>
<li>Make tags for GitLab installations running on MySQL case sensitive</li>
</ul>


<p>And the following were fixed with 7.10.2, also included here:</p>

<ul>
<li>A bug when using the Gitorious importer</li>
<li>A bug that prevented adding group members through the admin screen</li>
<li>Broken links on the merge request page leading to CI services</li>
<li>A 500 error when trying to search in the wiki</li>
<li>A 500 error when trying to add new tags to a project</li>
<li>A bug where commit data would not appear in some subdirectories due to escaped slashes</li>
<li>A bug where branches with escaped characters in their names would not always work
in the compare view</li>
</ul>


 


<h2>Upgrade barometer</h2>

<p>There is a migration that loops through all tags.
This can take a while for larger installations.</p>

<p>The upgrade can be performed online.</p>

<p>Theoretically, there is a small chance that if a tag is created during
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/db/migrate/20150425164649_add_taggings_counter_cache_to_tags.acts_as_taggable_on_engine.rb">migration</a>
of that specific tag, the tag counter gets a value that is
slightly higher or lower than its actual value. We do not believe this
is reason to schedule downtime and recommend performing the upgrade online.</p>
