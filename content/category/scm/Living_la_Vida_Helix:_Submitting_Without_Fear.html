    Living la Vida Helix: Submitting Without Fear</title></head><body>From:<a href=http://www.perforce.com/blog/150609/living-la-vida-helix-submitting-without-fear>http://www.perforce.com/blog/150609/living-la-vida-helix-submitting-without-fear</a><br><br><div><p>One of the common complaints I hear about centralized version control systems is that they are scary. With every commit being immediately visible there is a feeling that you may screw up everything for your co-workers. What&#8217;s worse is that you generally don&#8217;t have the power to clean up after yourself. How many of us have had to sheepishly go ask the admin to obliterate something?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/viva-la-helix-fear-blog.jpg"></p>
<p>With P4D (which we now call Helix Versioning Engine) becoming a proper DVCS, you now can manipulate history that has not yet been shared with other people. Than means you can commit to your heart&#8217;s content, and then sweep through later to keep just the interesting commits. It also means that if you accidentally submit something you can deal with it.</p>
<p>Just recently while doing some cleanup work in the Workshop I had just one of these cases. I&#8217;d like to walk you through what happened so that you can see how unsubmit and resubmit will help you.</p>
<h4>Setting the scene</h4>
<p>A user had reported that a number of files that I had added the day before had all of their line endings mangled. The files were already in the shared server, so I didn&#8217;t want to run p4 unsubmit there, and anyway I feel it is important for my failures to remain on display for all to see.</p>
<p>So I got to work updating the files.</p>
<pre> p4 fetch</pre>
<p>Everyting was up-to-date. Next to find the files with the bad line endings.</p>
<pre>grep -lIUr --color <p>"^R"</p></pre>
<p>I was lucky and it was just a handful of files. Thankfully turning Windows line endings into Unixones is a piece of cake with P4D.</p>
<pre>p4 client -o | sed s/LineEnd: local/LineEnd: share | p4 client -i</pre>
<p>Now to get the files synced with the correct line endings and submitted:</p>
<pre>p4 sync -f </pre>
<pre>p4 submit -d <p>"Fixing up some busted line endings that snuck in"</p></pre>
<p>All was well and good until I realized that in my excitement I&#8217;d mangled some solution files which probably wanted those '\R&#8217;s. Thankfully I hadn&#8217;t pushed, so I could quickly clean up my mess.</p>
<pre>p4 changes -m1</pre>
<pre>p4 unsubmit @<p>12345</p></pre>
<p>I identified my last change number, and then unsubmitted it. At this point I had all of my changed files in a shelf. In this case I had only one changelist, but I still decided to use p4 resubmit to apply the change. p4 resubmit makes it easy to reapply the changes in order.</p>
<pre>p4 resubmit</pre>
<p>This kicks me into interactive mode. Because there is a lot you can do with resubmit and I always forget the options, I hit '?' to see the list.</p>
<pre>Specify next action ( l/m/e/c/r/R/s/d/b/v/V/a/q ) or ? <p class="s1">for </p>help: ?
The following actions are available:
c Modify the change description <p class="s1">for </p>this change
m Merge this change, <p class="s1">then </p>submit <p class="s1">if </p>no conflicts
e Merge this change, <p class="s1">then exit for </p>further editing
r Interactively resolve this change, <p class="s1">then</p>
submit <p class="s1">if </p>no conflicts
a Add (squash) this change into the next unsubmitted
change
s Skip this change and move on to the next
d Delete this change without submitting it
b Begin again from the earliest remaining change
l List the changes remaining to be processed
v View the current change in short form
V View the current change with full diffs
R Display the status of resolved and unresolved merges
q Quit the resubmit operation&lt;
? Display this help.</pre>
<p>In this case I wanted to resubmit all of the files except the solution files, so I selected e</p>
<p>That merged my change back in, but then dropped me back to the command prompt so I could further mangle the files. A quick revert got rid of the changed solution files, and then I used p4 resubmit -Re to resume the resubmit process.</p>
<pre>p4 revert ....sln
p4 resubmit -Re</pre>
<p>P4D submitted the change again, and cleaned up the shelf for me since I no longer needed it. With that tidied up I was ready to push and share my changes with the community.</p>
<pre>p4 push</pre>
<p>Sharing that broken change wouldn&#8217;t have been the end of the world, but I felt so much more in control being able to clean up those .sln files before pushing out my change. Ever wish you could undo a merge between branches? With p4 unsubmit you can. Helix Versioning Engine gives you a way to safely experiment, modifying history as need be to make sure the changes your coworkers see are the ones you want them to see.</p>
<p>Interested in trying it yourself? You&#8217;re just a download of our Helix Versioning Engine and p4 init away from being able to try this all yourself. If you&#8217;d like to push to a shared server the Workshop has been running 2015.1 since beta, and Helix Cloud is also using it. As always we&#8217;re here to help, so if you have questions, just shout!</p>
