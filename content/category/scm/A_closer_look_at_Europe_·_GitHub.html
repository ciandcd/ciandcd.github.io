This week we thought we'd take a closer look at Europe, which happens to be the largest demographic of GitHub users around the world, representing 36% of site traffic.</p>

<p>Around 32 million people visit GitHub each month, and most of this traffic comes from outside of the United States (74% in fact!).
The most active countries in Europe are Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, but if we look at users per capita we see a different story -- Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands lead the way. London, Paris and Stockholm top the list of European cities most active on GitHub.</p>

<p>The goals of building better software are universal, and several European organizations are setting the example.
Companies like <a href="https://enterprise.github.com/stories/sap">SAP</a> and XS4ALL are driving innovation with software, while <a href="https://alphagov.github.io/">The UK Government Digital Services</a> and <a href="https://government.github.com/community/">dozens of other European government agencies and services</a> are developing new ways to serve citizens.</p>

<p>Today, around 10% of GitHub employees are based in Europe, with a dozen new faces in the last year alone -- many of whom are focused solely on helping our European customers build great software.
A few of us are here in the UK for <a href="http://londontechnologyweek.co.uk/">London Tech Week</a> and <a href="https://enterconf.com/">EnterConf</a> in Belfast. There will be plenty more meetups ahead if we don't see you there.</p>
