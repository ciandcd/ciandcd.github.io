<p><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/98681/8116294/212a0ff0-1036-11e5-9450-b08d1cb7999c.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/98681/8116294/212a0ff0-1036-11e5-9450-b08d1cb7999c.jpg" alt="New GitHub header"></a></p>

<p>The new header gives you faster access to <a href="https://github.com/blog/1901-managing-issues-and-pull-requests-across-repositories">your pull requests and issues dashboards</a> from anywhere on the site. If you're unfamiliar with them, these dashboards list all of your open pull requests and issues&#8212;as well as those you've been mentioned in or are assigned to&#8212;in one place. Use them to stay up to date on what needs to be done across your projects.</p>

<p>Lastly, clicking your avatar now opens a new dropdown menu with links to your profile, account settings, and more. As a small bonus, we've also included a new Your stars link for easy access to your starred repositories.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
