<p><a href="http://codeconf.com/">CodeConf</a> is next week, and I couldn't be more excited to bring the open source community together to exchange ideas and have some fun in Nashville. There are a few updates I'd like to share: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>On June 24, the day before the conference, we'll be hosting a <strong>meet &amp; greet</strong> for attendees who would like to register early. This event is free and open to the public, so if you aren't attending CodeConf but live in the Nashville area and would like to stop by, <a href="http://www.ticketbase.com/events/codeconf-2015">grab a ticket here</a>. We'll be congregating on the second floor of <a href="http://theacmenashville.com/">Acme Feed &amp; Seed</a> downtown beginning at 5:30pm </p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>workshop schedule</strong> has been updated, and I have opened up more space in each session for those interested. If you'd like to snag one of the newly available tickets, <a href="http://www.ticketbase.com/events/codeconf-2015">go for it!</a> </p></li>
</ul>

<p>There's still time to grab a CodeConf ticket. <a href="http://codeconf.com/">Take a look at the website for the full schedule of sessions, workshops, and sponsors.</a> I hope to see you in Nashville. </p>
