    P4Python goes pip</title></head><body>From:<a href=http://www.perforce.com/blog/150514/p4python-goes-pip-0>http://www.perforce.com/blog/150514/p4python-goes-pip-0</a><br><br><div><p><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/title-tip-tricks9.png"></p>
<p>In recent years Python has changed its package manager strategy, and the result is <strong>pip</strong>. Pip is a powerful package manager that simplifies the creation and consumption of Python packages, turning the <a href="http://pypi.python.org">Python Package Index</a> into a hub of an ever-growing number of useful packages.</p>
<p>P4Python always had to stay away from the package index because it requires binary builds for some platforms. With the advent of the <a href="http://pythonwheels.com/">wheel</a> format, this has changed. Wheels are Python packages that can contain binary builds on Windows and OSX, allowing package creators to precompile their packages.</p>
<p>P4Python 2015.1 has been uploaded to the Python Package Index. For you this means installing the latest release of P4Python becomes a simple:</p>
<pre>    pip install p4python</pre><p>Easier, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>However, there are a few preparations you need to make before you can run this command the first time successfully:</p>
<ol><li>You need to have the right version of Python installed: 2.7, 3.3 or 3.4. Python 2.6 is supported but we have not uploaded binaries for it.</li>
<li>You need to install pip. It comes with Python 3.4 and 2.7.9 automatically; everyone else will need to install it, for example from <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py">here</a>, and make sure the pip executable is in your PATH.</li>
<li>There is currently no binary wheel format available for Linux, so pip will download the source code of P4Python and attempt to build it. This requires &#8216;python-dev&#8217; and &#8216;build-essential&#8217; installed on Debian-based distributions (using apt) and the equivalent on RPM-based (using yum).</li>
</ol><p>In order to build P4Python automatically from Pip, setup.py has also gained some new tricks.</p>
<p>First of all, it now uses setuptools and not distutils, so you need to have setuptools installed if you want to build it on, say, Python 2.6.</p>
<p>If you run setup.py without the &#8211;apidir option, setup will now go off and attempt to download the correct P4API binaries from <a href="ftp://ftp.perforce.com">the Perforce FTP site</a> for your platform. The API will be downloaded and unpacked into the temp directory and used automatically by the build process.</p>
<p>You can still download the source or the packages, of course, and install P4Python the traditional way if you prefer.</p>
<p>I found pip amazingly simple to use, and I hope it will make your life a lot easier when installing P4Python.
