We're happy to announce <a href="https://github.com/orgs/improved-permissions?utm_source=github_site&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=organization-permissions">major improvements to GitHub organization permissions</a>. These improvements include new customizable member privileges, fine-grained team permissions, and more open communication.</p>

<p>The improved permissions system gives your organization the flexibility to work the way you want. Here are just a few highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>(Opt-in) Members can view and mention all teams, even when they're not on those teams.</li>
<li>(Opt-in) Members can create repositories without help from an owner.</li>
<li>Members can create new teams to self-organize with the people they work with.</li>
<li>Owners can give just the right amount of access to contractors and interns by adding them to repositories without giving them the privileges of organization members.</li>
<li>And many more! <a href="https://github.com/orgs/improved-permissions?utm_source=github_site&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=organization-permissions">Learn about GitHub's improved organization permissions</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these new features give your organization the ability to work together seamlessly without everyone needing to be an owner.</p>

<p>Once these features launch, organization owners will be able to turn on new permissions as needed. Simply opt-in when you're ready.</p>

<p>We're rolling out our improved permissions system to a select group of users who will be asked to provide feedback over a short survey as part of the program. If you're interested in being one of the first to try it out on GitHub.com, <a href="https://github.com/orgs/improved-permissions?utm_source=github_site&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=organization-permissions">sign your organization up for early access</a>.</p>

<p>In the next few months, every organization on GitHub.com will have the improved permissions system.</p>
