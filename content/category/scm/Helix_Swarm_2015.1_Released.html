    Helix Swarm 2015.1 Released</title></head><body>From:<a href=http://www.perforce.com/blog/150608/helix-swarm-20151-released>http://www.perforce.com/blog/150608/helix-swarm-20151-released</a><br><br><div><p><a http://www.perforce.com//collaboration>Swarm</a> is two years old this month!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rewarding to think that just two years ago, our collaboration engine was only just getting into the hands of our customers. Fast-forward to today, where Swarm plays a big part in the daily workflows of so many innovative companies. With much of the functionality now matured, we wanted to expand Swarm beyond just our English-speaking customers.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/swarm-japan-bee.jpg"></p>
<p>With the latest release of Helix Swarm, we&#8217;ve translated the product into Japanese. It&#8217;s available through our exclusive partner in Japan, the <a href="http://www.toyo.co.jp">TOYO Corporation</a>. TOYO provides expert consulting and support to our Japanese customers, and Swarm joins the <a href="http://www.perforce.com/versioning-engine">Helix Versioning Engine</a> and our popular visual client, <a href="http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-client">P4V</a>, in the suite of Perforce products available in Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>Localization Support for Swarm </strong></p>
<p>The Swarm team spent the last couple of months creating a localization framework and translating the product and documentation into Japanese. The next languages on our list are Korean and Simplified Chinese. If there&#8217;s a language you&#8217;d like us to add to our list of localizations, please send us your request via the <a href="http://forums.perforce.com/index.php?/forum/29-swarm/">Perforce Swarm Forums</a> or by emailing <a href="mailto:support@perforce.com?subject=Request%20for%20Perforce%20Helix%20Swarm">support</a> and we&#8217;ll put it on our radar.</p>
<p>Aside from the <strong>localization support</strong>, other new functionalities include: &#160; &#160;&#160;</p>
<ul><li>Files and folders are downloadable as ZIP archives</li>
<li>Swarm now limits the number of files to display in a committed change to a configurable default of 1000</li>
<li>Configurable timeout sets thresholds for large commits</li>
</ul><p>More details can be found in the <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/swarm/whatsnew.html">What's new in 2015.1</a> section of our user guide.</p>
