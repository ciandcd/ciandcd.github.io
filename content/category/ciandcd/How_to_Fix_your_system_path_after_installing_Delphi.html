<br>
The Windows Path environment variable has a limit of <p>1023</p>&#160;*&#160;<p><strong>2,048</strong>&#160;</p>characters, a stupidly short limit in this day and age, and when this limit is exceeded the path is truncated. Why this limit still exists on windows I have no idea.. for that matter why it ever existed... anyway, we're stuck with it (along with it's best buddy, MAX_PATH).&#160;</p><br>
<br>
Each version of Delphi adds over 200 characters to your system path. Worst still, they add those 200+ characters to the front of the path, not the end. What happens, is that eventually, important entries get truncated off end of the path, and <strong>strange things happen</strong>. You will find programs will not run, the task bar displays the wrong icons for programs, even getting to the control panel can be problematic.&#160;<br>
<br>
If you look at the entries that XE7 added to the start of your path you will see something like this :<br>
<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\15.0\bin;<br>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\15.0\bin64;<br>
</p>C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\15.0\Bpl;<br>
C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\15.0\Bpl\Win64;<br>
<br>
Fortunately this can be shortened by the use of junction points. Sadly, this will polute your C: drive with new folders but it's better than the alternative.<br>
<br>
The trick is to create links for the most common paths, so on mine I created these<br>
For XE5 and earlier :<br>
mklink /j RS C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\RAD Studio<br>
mklink /j rspub&#160;C:\Users\Public\Documents\RAD Studio<br>
<br>
XE6 and above&#160;<br>
<br>
mklink /j Studio&#160;C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio<br>
<p>mklink /j spub&#160;</p><p>C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio</p><br>
<br>
Once you have those junction points, you can then edit your path and replace the long paths, for example (for XE7) :<br>
<br>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\15.0\bin -&gt;&#160;</p><p>C:\Studio\15.0\bin<br>
</p><p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\15.0\bin64 -&gt;&#160;C:\Studio\15.0\bin64</p><br>
<p>C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\15.0\Bpl&#160;-&gt;&#160;C:\spub\15.0\Bpl</p><br>
<p>C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\15.0\Bpl\Win64 - &gt; c:\spub\15.0\Bpl\Win64<br>
</p><br>
So for XE7, that cuts it down from 218 to 80 characters, if like me you also have multiple versions of Rad Studio installed, this can be a big saving.<br>
<br>
As for Rad Studio, it's extremely rude to add things to the start of the path, the truncation it causes can ruin a machine.. I wasted several hours again today after installing XE7. Embarcadero were told about this issue many times over several releases.. according to the <a></a><strong>PLEASE ADD IT TO THE END!!</strong> and save us all a bunch of time.&#160;<br>
<br>
*&#160;Correction, max path length is 2048 - very difficult to find a difinitive source of this information on the microsoft site - the max size of an env variable is 2048, however I have seen the path variable truncated at 1024 many times.&#13;
