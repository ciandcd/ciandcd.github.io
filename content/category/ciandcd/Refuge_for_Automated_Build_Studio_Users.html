                        SmartBear recently discontinued development of Automated Build Studio and deleted pretty much all references to it from their website. <br>
<br>
Within hours of the smartbear email going out to ABS users, we started getting questions about crossgrade discounts, and we're more than happy to help. &#160;<br>
<br>
If you are an ABS user, contact us (sales @ finalbuilder.com ) with proof of purchase (invoice) for ABS and we'll provide you with a 50% off discount coupon for FinalBuilder 7 Professional Edition.&#160;<br>
<br>
This is a limited time once only offer, valid until May 15th 2014. &#160;Spread the word to your fellow ABS users.&#160;<br>
<br>
While you you are checking out FinalBuilder, be sure to take a look at our Continuous Integration Server product, Continua CI. It's vastly superior to the CI features in ABS, but still allows you to create your build process using a visual build tool (FinalBuilder). &#160;&#13;
