<br clear="all"><p>In March 2015, we announced an evening event at our JetBrains office in Munich where we would show our guests how to Use ReSharper Effectively, and Perform Exploratory Code Reviews with Upsource. <strong>The level of interest was so great that we decided to hold an additional night to accommodate the volume of demand.</strong> We could have filled a much larger venue, but we wanted to provide an opportunity to mingle with the team in a relaxed informal atmosphere. In hindsight, this was a good decision.</p>
<p>Over two nights, March 24th and 25th, <strong>120 participants</strong> gathered at JetBrains office to see in action <strong><a title="Repository Browser and Code Review Tool" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/" target="_blank">Upsource</a></strong> and <strong><a title="Why Prefer ReSharper Ultimate" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/dotnet/" target="_blank">ReSharper Ultimate</a></strong> (ReSharper, dotTrace, dotMemory and dotCover). The feedback that we received on location and through a follow-up survey were overwhelmingly positive, so much so that we are <strong>currently planning to extend the same concept with 3 hour in-depth workshops</strong>.</p>
