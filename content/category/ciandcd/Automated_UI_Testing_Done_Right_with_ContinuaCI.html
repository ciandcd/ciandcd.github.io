<h1>
Automated UI Testing Done Right with ContinuaCI</h1>
You have just completed an awesomely complex change to your shinny new webapp! &#160;After
running all your unit tests things are in the green and looking clean.<br>
<br>
Very satisfied at the quality of your work you fire up the application to verify
that everything is still working as advertised. &#160;Below is what greets you on
the root path of your app:&#160;<br>
<br>
<img src="/Portals/0/ArticleImages/BlogImages/peter/404-notfound-ie5.gif" alt="Funny error"><br>
<br>
We have all been here at some time or another! &#160;What happened! &#160;Perhaps
it was not your code that broke it! &#160;Maybe the issue originated from another
part of your organisation, or maybe it came from somewhere on the "inter-webs".
&#160;<br>
<br>
Its time to look at the underlying problem however ..... &#160;testing web user
interfaces is hard! &#160;Its time consuming and difficult to get right. &#160;Manual
clicks, much typing, cross referencing client specifications etc, surely there must
be an easier way. &#160;At the end of the day we DO need to test our user interfaces

<h4>
Automated Web UI Testing</h4>
<br>
Thankfully UI testing today can be Automated, running real browsers in real end
to end functional tests, to ensure our results meet (and continue to meet) expectations.

For the sake of brevity and clarity in this demonstration we will focus on testing
an existing endpoint. &#160;It is considered common place to find functional tests
included as part of a wider build pipeline, which may consist of such steps as:&#160;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Build</li>
    <li>Unit Test</li>
    <li>Deploy to Test Environment</li>
    <li>Perform Functional Tests</li>
    <li>Deploy to Production</li>
</ul>
<br>
In this article we will be focusing on the functional testing component of this
pipeline. &#160;We will proceed on the assumption that your code has already been,
built unit tested and deployed to a Functional Test environment.  Today we
will;<br>

    <li>Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition SP1 or greater (<a href="http://visualstudio.com/">visualstudio.com</a>)</li>
    <li>Microsoft Dot Net Framework version 4 or greater</li>
    <li>Java JRE (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>)</li>

</ul>
<h2>
Step1: Prepare a Selenium endpoint</h2>
Firstly we will prepare for our UI tests by setting up a Selenium server. &#160;<span><a></a><span><a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> is a browser automation framework which will be used to 'remote control' a real browser.</span></span><br>
<br>
Log into the machine you have chosen for the Selenium server with administrator
privileges<br>
Download and install Mozilla Firefox (getfirefox.com), this will be the browser
that we target as part of this example, however Selenium can target lots of other
browsers. &#160;For a full breakdown please <a></a><br>
Download Selenium Server (<a></a><br>
<br>
Place it into a permanent
location of you choosing, in our example ("C:\Program Files (x86)\SeleniumServer")
&#160; &#160;&#160;<br>
Download NSSM (<a></a><br>
<br>
Ensure that port 4444 is set to allow traffic (this is the default communications&#160;port
for Selenium)&#160;<br>
<br>
Open a console and run the following commands:&#160;<br>
<p>"C:\Program Files (x86)\nssm-2.22\win64\nssm.exe"
install Selenium-Server "java" "-jar \"C:\Program Files (x86)\SeleniumServer\selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0.jar\""<br>
net start Selenium-Server</p><br>
<br>
<img src="/Portals/0/ArticleImages/BlogImages/peter/install-sel-1.png" alt="name project">
<br>
&#160;<br>
In order to uninstall the Selenium server service, the following commands can be
run:&#160;<br>
<p>net stop Selenium-Server<br>
"C:\Program Files (x86)\nssm-2.22\win64\nssm.exe" remove Selenium-Server </p>
<br>
<br>
<img src="/Portals/0/ArticleImages/BlogImages/peter/install-sel-2.png" alt="name project">
<br>
<h2>
Step2: Create a test class and add it to source control</h2>
Create a new class library project in Visual Studio, &#160;lets call it 'tests'<br>
Open the Nuget Package Manager Console window (tools menu-&gt; library package manager
-&gt; package manager console), select the test project as the default project and
run the following script:&#160;<br>
<br>
Install-Package Selenium.Automation.Framework<br>
Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver<br>
Install-Package Selenium.Support<br>
Install-Package NUnit<br>
Install-Package NUnit.Runners<br>
<br>
Create a new class called within the tests project (lets call it tests) and place
the below code (Note: line 23 should be changed with location to the Selenium-Server
we setup in the previous step):<br>
<br>
<pre class="brush: c#; toolbar:true">using System;
using System.Text;
using NUnit.Framework;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Remote;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI;

namespace SeleniumTests
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class test
    {
        private RemoteWebDriver driver;
       

        [SetUp]
        public void SetupTest()
        {

            // Look for an environment variable
            string server = null;
            server = System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SELENIUM_SERVER");
            if (server == null)
            {
                server = "http:// *** PUT THE NAME OF YOUR SERVER HERE ***:4444/wd/hub";
            }
            
            // Remote testing
            driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri(server), DesiredCapabilities.Firefox());
        }

        [TearDown]
        public void TeardownTest()
        {
            try
            {
                driver.Quit();
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                // Ignore errors if unable to close the browser
            }
        }

        [Test]
        public void FirstSeleniumTest()
        {
            driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://www.google.com/");
            IWebElement query = driver.FindElement(By.Name("q"));
            query.SendKeys("a test");
            Assert.AreEqual(driver.Title, "Google"); 
        }
       
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Step3: Test the test!</h2>
Build the solution&#160;<br>
Open NUnit build runner (by default this is located at ~\packages\NUnit.Runners.2.6.3\tools\nunit.exe)
, Select file -&gt; Open Project, and locate the tests dll that you have build in
the previous step<br>
click the run button<br>
~ 15 seconds or so you should have one green test!<br>
<br>
<img src="/Portals/0/ArticleImages/BlogImages/peter/create-project-17.png" alt="name project">
<br>
<br>
So what just happened? &#160;Behind the scenes an instance of firefox was opened
(on the Selenium Server), perform a simple google search query and undertook a simple
Nunit assertion has verified the name of the window was equal to "Google", very
cool!. &#160;<br>
<br>
Now lets make the test fail, go ahead and change line 78, lets say "zzGoogle", build,
and rerun the test. &#160;We now have a failing test. &#160;Go ahead and change
it back so that we have a single passing test.<br>

<br>
Build, and run the test. &#160;<br>
<br>
In this example we added an additional test to perform a google search, wait at
maximum 10 seconds for &#160;results to display, take a screenshot (stored it to
disk), and perform an NUnit assertion. &#160;The screenshot output from the test
can be made available as an artifact within Continua!
<br>
<br>
Firstly lets commit our changes; "hg commit -m "added a more advanced test""<br>
<br>
Open the configuration in Continua CI (clicking the pencil icon)<br>
Navigate to the stages section&#160;<br>
Double click on the stage name (which will bring up the edit stage Dialogue box)&#160;<br>
Click on the Workspace rules tab<br>
Add the following line to the bottom of the text area: "/ &lt; $Source.test_repo$/tests/bin/Release/**.png".
