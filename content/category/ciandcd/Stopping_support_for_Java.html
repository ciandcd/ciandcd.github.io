Oracle and OpenJDK no longer support Java 6. So it is time for Go to stop supporting it. 14.2.0 will be last Go release which will work with Java 6. Any new Go release beyond 14.2.0 might not work with Java 6.  </p>

<p>If you have not already moved to Java 7, we request you to do so. Should you face any issues please do write to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-cd">community mailing list</a>. </p>
