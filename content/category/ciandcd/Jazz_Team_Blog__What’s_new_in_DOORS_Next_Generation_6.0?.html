<h2>Configuration Management</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-doors-next-generation/releases/6.0" target="_blank">DOORS Next Generation 6.0</a> is our first release providing native configuration management of requirements, enabling functionality for strategic reuse and Product Line Engineering. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">RM offers the ability to define the scope of a project, program, or deliverable&#8212;but unless you have control over change this scope could well consume more of your project costs than you expected. Placing requirements under CM allows for the scope to be controlled, while enabling your teams to work in parallel versions at the same time without the need to make project copies to handle variants. </p>
<p></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-13270" href="https://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2015/06/26/what%e2%80%99s-new-in-doors-next-generation-6-0/cfgm/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13270" title="CfgM" src="https://jazz.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CfgM.png" alt="" width="524" height="179"></a></p>
<p>  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On a basic level, CM provides a way to manage groups of artifacts and their versions. Versions can be split to support different variants and merged in order to deliver changes of requirements back to accepted releases. With CM, users can efficiently create different streams to help manage parallel versions without the need to make copies of their requirements. Additionally, there is robust linking that is specific to the stream the user is working in. This means that following the link shows users the requirement, test, or design element on the other end of the link that is appropriate for the stream they are working in. The ability to compare across streams and baselines helps users to understand how their versions or variants are different and to correct any mistakes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The functionality has been designed expecting only a small number of people to engage directly with parallel versions and CM, while the rest of the engineers continue with their work, mostly as if nothing has changed. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By default, these new capabilities are turned off and project administrators have to enable them for the server and for each project area where users want to take advantage of them. </p>
<h2>Global Configuration Management</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">For some time we have been discussing the benefits of being able to support use cases such as &#8220;link a version of a test case with a version of a requirement&#8221;.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-13269" href="https://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2015/06/26/what%e2%80%99s-new-in-doors-next-generation-6-0/global-configurations/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13269" title="Global Configurations" src="https://jazz.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Global-Configurations.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="215"></a>6.0 extends CM with a federated approach to lifecycle information. Strategic reuse for complex systems and software is now possible for requirements (RDNG), design (RDM), test (RQM) and software development (RTC). </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">Plan and manage the reuse      of configurations in the many versions or variants of the product or      software line.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Define complex products      and applications as hierarchies of components and reuse those components      in multiple products and applications.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Automatically handle links      between artifacts when branching or delivering changes to another stream      such as, links between tests and requirements.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Create cross lifecycle      baselines to support parallel development of multiple versions and      variants, branching and merging, and change management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Diagram editor</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Users can create many types of diagrams to refine and communicate their ideas and to elaborate their requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13268" href="https://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2015/06/26/what%e2%80%99s-new-in-doors-next-generation-6-0/picture1-2/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-13268" title="DNG informal diagram editor" src="https://jazz.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Picture11.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="288"></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The new diagram editor provides high-quality diagrams that are simple to create in all supported browsers without the need for a Java&#8482; plug-in. The large selection of shapes and themed styles make it easy to create many types of diagrams with eye-catching color palettes. To increase productivity, users can use the keyboard to create all the diagrams. They can comment on and create links between individual diagram elements and other artifacts. Diagrams can be added to modules and embedded in rich-text artifacts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This release could well be introducing the most fundamental function into a requirements management tool since RM systems began. While we continue our drive with usability and productivity we are also providing support for requirements configuration management, built from the ground up as part of the native tool, rather than simply integrating to an external CM system.</p>
