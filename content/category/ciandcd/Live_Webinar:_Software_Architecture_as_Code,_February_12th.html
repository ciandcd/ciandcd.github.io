Register now and join us&#160;<strong>Thursday, February 12th, 15:00 &#8211; 16:00 GMT</strong>&#160;(10:00 AM &#8211; 11:00 AM EST).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 2015 and with so much technology at our disposal, we&#8217;re still manually drawing software architecture diagrams in tools like Microsoft Visio. Furthermore, these diagrams often don&#8217;t reflect the implementation in code, and vice versa. This session will look at why this happens and how to resolve the conflict between software architecture and code through the use of architecturally-evident coding styles and the representation of software architecture models as code.</p>
