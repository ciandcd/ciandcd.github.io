<h2><strong>WebStorm</strong></h2>
<p>The WebStorm review by Martin Heller, InfoWorld Test Center Editor, highlights the core features that makes WebStorm &#8220;more than an editor&#8221; such as: built-in code inspections and code quality tools, Node.js and JavaScript debugger and tracer, Live edit, and integration with the testing tools.</p>
<h2><strong>IntelliJ IDEA</strong></h2>
<p>Just last month IntelliJ IDEA 14 picked up the&#160;<strong><a title="Jolt Awards 2015: Coding Tools" href="http://www.drdobbs.com/joltawards/jolt-awards-2015-coding-tools/240169420?pgno=6" target="_blank">2015 Jolt Productivity Award for Coding Tools</a></strong> and now InfoWorld&#8217;s 2015 Technology of the Year. What a great ending to 2014 and start to the new year!</p>
<p>Here is part of what Rick Grehan had to say in his review.</p>
<p>&#8220;Granted, we wish the Community edition were equipped with the sorts of J2EE development tools found only in the Ultimate edition: database tools, support for frameworks such as JPA and Hibernate, deployment tools for application servers like JBoss AS, WildFly, and Tomcat. Nevertheless, the Community edition makes a fine Java application development platform that also gives you Android tools, as well as support for other JVM languages like Groovy, Clojure, and Scala (the last two via free plug-ins). Whichever version of IntelliJ IDEA you use, you&#8217;ll find a rich array of tools designed to simplify otherwise tedious development chores.&#8221;</p>
