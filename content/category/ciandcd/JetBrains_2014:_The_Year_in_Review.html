<br clear="all"><p dir="ltr">Our team was hard at work in 2014 delivering new releases of our existing products and bringing new ones to market. In this post we are going to take a look at those and some of the other biggest moments of the year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you remember back to&#160;<strong><a title="JetBrains Day @ FooCaf&#233;" href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2013/09/12/jetbrains-day-foocafe-recap-announcements-and-videos/" target="_blank">JetBrains Day @ FooCaf&#233;</a></strong> in September 2013, we announced several new projects. 2014 saw those plans come to fruition. In February,&#160;<strong><a title="ReShaper C++" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/cpp.html" target="_blank">ReSharper C++ Early Access Program</a></strong>&#160;went live, in May&#160;<strong><a title="Nitra was made open source" href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2014/05/27/nitra-goes-open-source/" target="_blank">Nitra was made open source</a></strong>, September brought&#160;<strong><a title="CLion EAP program" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/" target="_blank">CLion EAP</a></strong>, and in December&#160;<strong><a title="Upsource" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/" target="_blank">Upsource</a></strong>, our repository browsing and code review tool, reached a stable 1.0 build.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6888" alt="Upsource" src="http://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pic_upsource.png" width="274" height="120"></p>
<p dir="ltr">We didn&#8217;t stop there. Two new products were also added to our portfolio:&#160;<strong><a title="0xDBE" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/dbe/" target="_blank">0xDBE</a></strong>, JetBrains&#8217; brand new IDE for DBAs and SQL developers, was first announced in June and in October&#160;<strong><a title="PyCharm Education Edition" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/" target="_blank">PyCharm Education Edition</a></strong>, a free IDE for learning and teaching programming with Python, went public. You may be interested in checking out our&#160;<strong><a title="Interactive Python Programming Course Contest" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/contest/" target="_blank"> Interactive Python Programming Course Contest</a></strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2014 we continued our commitment to the open source community through our various projects and by providing&#160;<strong><a title="Free Open Source Licenses" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/devnet/sponsorship/open-source/" target="_blank">free open source licenses</a></strong> to non-commercial OS software projects. In July a&#160;<strong><a title="New Kotlin website" href="http://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank">new open source Kotlin website</a></strong> went live and steady releases of JetBrains&#160;<strong><a title="Meta Programming System (MPS)" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/" target="_blank">Meta Programming System</a></strong> (MPS) continued to go out the door.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6889" alt="Open Source" src="http://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pic_pyCharm.png" width="415" height="83"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Travel again back in time to May 2013 when&#160;<strong><a title="Google to Build Android Studio on IntelliJ Platform" href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2013/05/15/intellij-idea-is-the-base-for-android-studio-the-new-ide-for-android-developers/" target="_blank">Google announced their selection of IntelliJ IDEA as the base of Android Studio</a></strong>. Well, in December, the highly anticipated&#160;<strong><a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html">Android Studio 1.0</a></strong> release hit the virtual shelves! This is a great example of open source collaboration working both ways with the work being done on Android Studio being incorporated back into <strong><a title="IntelliJ IDEA" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition</a></strong> and the free and open source <strong>Community Edition</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the proudest moments of the year came in September when we announced <strong><a title="JetBrains Student License Program" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/" target="_blank">JetBrains Student License Program</a></strong>. Through this program students and teachers have access to our entire product line of IDEs and .NET Tools. Within the first two weeks of the program, more than&#160;<strong><a title="34,000 students receive free licenses" href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2014/10/07/jetbrains-student-program-34k-students-join-in-two-weeks/" target="_blank">34,000 students were approved</a></strong> and now there are <strong>nearly 100,000 students using JetBrains tools for free!</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6890" alt="JetBrains Startup Discount" src="http://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pic_discount-2.png" width="149" height="103">Nearly a decade and a half on we haven&#8217;t forgotten our startup roots. In February we announced&#160;<strong><a title="JetBrains Startup Discount Plan" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/estore/startup/" target="_blank">JetBrains Startup Discount Plan</a></strong>. Software startup businesses that meet straightforward criteria get a <strong>50% discount on all of our products</strong>. If your startup is just getting off the ground, this is a great place to begin.</p>
<p>Lastly, here are some of the <strong>honors that our products picked up in 2014</strong>.</p>
 
<p><strong>2014 was a fantastic year and we expect more of the same excitement in 2015. We sincerely thank you; all of our friends and colleagues, for your continued support and wish you all the best in the coming year. Here&#8217;s to another outstanding and productive year in 2015!</strong></p>
