own system, this might be a great option for you.</p>

<p><strong>Edit on 11 November, 2014</strong> - This box has been updated to Go version 14.3. For information about
what's new in this release please see <a href="http://www.go.cd/releases/">http://www.go.cd/releases/</a></p>

<p>We've created an environment using Vagrant and Virtualbox. Once it's up, you'll have a full
Go installation including several example pipleines. </p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

<p><strong>In order to run this you'll need <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a> 
and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</strong> Both of these are available for most operating 
systems.</p>

<h3>Using the box</h3>

<p>To get started, open a command prompt in an empty directory and type...</p>

<blockquote>
vagrant init gocd/gocd-demo
</blockquote>

<p>This will create a file called Vagrantfile in your current directory. </p>

<p>Next, type...</p>

<blockquote>
vagrant up
</blockquote>

<p>Completion of this (especially the first time) will take quite a while, depending on your
bandwidth. Vagrant will be downloading the full box image (almost 1.4GB) from Vagrantcloud 
while you wait.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have an existing Go installation on the same machine as this virtual machine
you may get a port conflict. Vagrant will automatically map to a new port which will be 
shown in the startup messages. </p>

<p>After a few minutes, you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:8153/ on your local
machine and see the following...</p>

<p>These pipelines are all related, as shown in the following value stream map screenshot...</p>

<p>Feel free to play around with the installation and see how everything works. You can always
reset the box to it's orginal state if you need to!</p>

<h3>What's on the machine?</h3>

<p>The box will be updated as new things come out, but as of this writing...</p>

<ul>
<li>Go 14.3 Server</li>
<li>Go 14.3 Agent</li>
<li>3 very small PHP applications</li>
<li>Basic Capistrano deployment scripts</li>
<li>Local Git repo using Gitolite to manage permissions</li>
<li>A couple simple phpunit tests</li>
<li>A couple simple watir scripts</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the code is on the Virtualbox machine at /home/vagrant/projects. The easiest way
to access this is to type 'vagrant ssh' at the command prompt in the same place you 
started the machine.</p>

<p>The hope is that using this box you can see how real applications (even if they are small)
are built, tested and deployed with Go. </p>
