    DevOpsGuys announce RedGate partnership</title><meta name="date" content="2015-05-11 00:00"/><meta name="tags" content="devops" /></head><body>From:<a href=http://blog.devopsguys.com/2015/05/11/devopsguys-partner-redgate/>http://blog.devopsguys.com/2015/05/11/devopsguys-partner-redgate/</a><br><br><div><p><strong>More and more companies are now considering source control, continuous integration, and automated deployment for their database. To help them adopt each of these stages of Database Lifecycle Management (DLM), Redgate Software has launched a new partner program. Redgate Certified Consultants are now being trained in the USA, Europe and Australia &#8211; and many of them will be familiar to SQL Server professionals.</strong></p>
<p>The advantages of implementing any stage of DLM are many. Just as with Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), it speeds up the introduction of new features, and makes deployments reliable and error-free.</p>
<p>But even though Redgate tools are designed to plug into the tools companies already use for their application d</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>evelopment, questions can arise during the implementation process.</p>
<p>As Dan Wood of Northwest Cadence says: &#8220;How can we take a system designed to develop, build and deliver applications and make it work with databases as well? It is a question that has plagued a vast majority of the clients I have worked with over the past few years.&#8221;</p>
<p>To address this issue, Redgate&#8217;s new partner program is training expert consultants like Dan Wood in DLM &#8211; and giving them the tools and support they need to help clients on-site, or in training sessions.</p>
<p>The list of Certified Consultants is growing and already includes familiar faces like Ike Ellis and Northwest Cadence in the USA, The DevOpsGuys and Skelton Thatcher in the UK, and WARDY IT Solutions in Australia.</p>
<p>As John Theron of Redgate points out, the advantages are clear. &#8220;Redgate has spent a lot of time and effort joining the dots in DLM, and making it possible with a suite of dedicated tools, alongside learning materials and resources. The partner program complements this with a group of experts on the ground able to help companies on-site, and provide training in a series of public workshops.&#8221;</p>
<p>In places as far apart as Washington, London, San Diego, Philadelphia, Northern Ireland, and Baton Rouge, database professionals are how being trained in source control, continuous integration, and automated deployment for the database.</p>
<p>A measure of the success the training is already achieving can be found in the reaction from database professionals like Jim Dorame. A Database Systems Manager for a large scale educational assessment corporation in the Greater Minneapolis area, he <a href="http://www.jamesdorame.com/index.php/2014/08/22/continuous-integration-for-the-database-is-really-not-that-scary/">reviewed a continuous integration training day on his blog</a>.&#160; &#8220;This tool makes the job of the DBA easier as there will be little doubt that the database is in a consistent and correct state. This alone makes me smile, I cannot tell you how many times I&#8217;ve been executing a release and there was a piece missing that caused a failure.&#8221;</p>
