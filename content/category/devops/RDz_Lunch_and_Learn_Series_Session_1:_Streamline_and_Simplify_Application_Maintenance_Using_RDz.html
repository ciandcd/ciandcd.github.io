With a single click learn how spaghetti coded programs are structured, how control ended up in specific paragraphs or sections (when you were ready to bet your mortgage they couldn't), how data values circulate among variables, files, databases and relational tables (at a click) - and which statements read vs. update fields. Further? You will learn how RDz's Integrated Debugger can provide windows into your program's run-time behavior that make testing and debugging your maintenance changes as simple as possible.</p>
