Diverse, multiple heterogeneous environments are the norm, all of which must be maintained and deployed. Multiple tools and technologies connect, support and create work. Processes are inconsistent, which contributes to difficulties with end-to-end lifecycle governance. Waste, rework and technical debt abound.<br>

Woven throughout almost every one of these challenges is the need for speed and innovation while balancing quality and cost.
