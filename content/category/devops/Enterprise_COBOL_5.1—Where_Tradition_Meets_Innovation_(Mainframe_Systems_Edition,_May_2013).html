Despite that its specification was created more than 50 years ago, COBOL is still running the world&#8217;s most critical business applications. Many of us might not realize how much we rely on COBOL applications in our day-to-day lives. Every time we use an ATM, book an airline ticket, process a check or make an insurance claim, we&#8217;re using a COBOL application to process the transaction, and there&#8217;s a good chance this application is running on System z.</p>
