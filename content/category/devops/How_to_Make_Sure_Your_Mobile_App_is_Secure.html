This approach makes sense: According to&#160;<a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank">a comScore report</a>, the number of mobile Internet users outnumbered desktop ones for the first time at some point in late 2013, and has since achieved significant separation. Many companies have responded to this change by implementing bring-your-own-device policies and <a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/products/enterprise-test-management">building mobile apps</a> that complement their full websites, mobile Web presence and/or desktop applications.</p>

<p><strong>Watch out for pitfalls in mobile apps: General risks and the recent Starbucks example</strong><br>
 However, both BYOD policies and mobile app development require due diligence around cybersecurity if they are to be worthwhile. Safety starts with well-designed applications that are strongly authenticated, do not leak sensitive data and are safe from popular attack vectors like brute-force password guessing. Unfortunately, many apps still have a long way to go on these fronts.</p>

<p>An early 2014 study from MetaIntell discovered that 92 percent of the top 500 most popular Android apps at the time&#160;<a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IlFkOTzivnkJ:https://metaintelli.com/blog/2014/01/22/metaintell-identifies-enterprise-security-risks-privacy-risks-and-data-leakage-in-92-of-top-500-android-mobile-applications/+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" target="_blank">created privacy risks due to data leakage</a>. Wary of leaky apps as well as what kinds of information users put into them, enterprises have understandably been concerned about the impact of mobile apps on their operations and BYOD initiatives. Security is often the biggest barrier to effective BYOD, and justifiably so considering that&#160;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/08/26/byod-bring-your-own-device/14393635/" target="_blank">barely more than 40 percent of employees</a>&#160;are required to have a security tool installed, according to Webroot.</p>

<p>To get a sense of what could go wrong with today's mobile apps, consider what recently happened to Starbucks. The company's app is a mainstay on many phones, and at one time it accounted for the bulk of all mobile payments made in North America. The issue that arose over the last few months involved unauthorized card reloads and apparent account hijackings.</p>

<p>The causes may have been mixed, with&#160;<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2484245,00.asp" target="_blank">poor password management</a>&#160;on the part of users possibly exacerbated by exploitation of the app's auto-reload feature and an April 2015 outage of the coffee chain's point-of-sale systems. At the end of the day, Starbucks implemented additional security questions and has been urged to add two-factor authentication into the app to prevent erroneous transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Catching mobile app security issues with a test management solution</strong><br>
 As we can see, mobile app security is multifactorial, requiring best efforts on the parts of end users, developers and infrastructure/network providers. For enterprises, the best approach to ensuring long-term security is to catch potential vulnerabilities early and often with a test management system.</p>

<p>A test management solution supports both <a href="https://www.getzephyr.com/insights/when-use-manual-testing-vs-automated-testing">automated and manual testing</a>, and receiving updates&#160;in real-time offers you the ability to make important decisions once issues arise. Regardless of how many tests, sprints and projects your company is running, all of them should be conveniently viewed from a lone interface, enabling a single source of truth that keeps your mobile app development initiatives on track.</p>
