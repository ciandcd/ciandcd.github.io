<p>So, aching, tired and happy the DOGs returned from <a href="http://www.trekfest.org.uk/">TrekFest 2015</a>&#160;in the Welsh mountains having raised &#163;1,143.00 for the Countess Mountbatten Hospice and SSNAP &#8211; two charities close to the heart of the team. That&#8217;s 114% of our initial target, so a huge thank you to everyone who donated so generously.</p>
<p>The weather could not have been better for a long, scenic ramble in one of the UKs most beautiful spots; beautifully sunny with a refreshing breeze kept the team going. We completed the trek in approximately 5 and a half hours, just in time for a piece of cake and a glass of celebratory champagne at the finish line.</p>
<p>Everyone had a thoroughly enjoyable time and we&#8217;re all looking forward to the next DOG adventure!</p>
