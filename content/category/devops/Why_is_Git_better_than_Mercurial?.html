    Why is Git better than Mercurial?</title></head><body>From:<a href=http://java.dzone.com/articles/why-git-better-mercurial>http://java.dzone.com/articles/why-git-better-mercurial</a><br><br><div><p class="print-link"></p><p>&#160;</p><p>Which of the two main distributed version control systems (DVCS),
 Mecurial and GIT, is better and why? This is an old argument, with 
forum posts galore about which is better; with users of both arguing 
their case, however this argument never seems to be resolved. This is 
because the feature sets are so similar, and after researching the 
various strengths and weaknesses it became clear that they both have 
clear advantages for certain situations, &#8211; different use cases. Below we
 have listed both pros and cons for both Git and Mercurial in order for 
our readers to be able to make their own decision as to what is best for
 them, after all user requirements and team requirements differ; there 
is no one size fits all.</p>
<h2>Commonly found comments about Git</h2>
<p>GIT is overly complex in every sense of the word, in particular the 
information model and the command line syntax as well as the help 
documentation, none of it is easy to understand. The statement &#8220;if you 
don&#8217;t understand the functionality don&#8217;t use it, just use it like 
subversion&#8221; just doesn&#8217;t fit for the simple reason that most commands 
lead to further commands, where simple actions can require complex 
actions to undo or refine.</p>
<p>The decision as to whether to use Git on a development project or 
not, is primarily a question of how knowledgeable of Git the individuals
 are within the team, a single weak link can bring down the entire team.
 The obvious example of this is seen in the version control of Git. It 
is simply put, &#8211; unsafe, &#8211; prone to accidental alteration by users 
(potentially affecting the entire team), therefore a high minimum 
knowledge requirement is necessary. Consider a Git test, what should the
 pass rate be? 70%, 80% or 90%?</p>
<p>Continuing on the overly complex nature of Git&#8217;s design, the obvious 
point is that it puts control firmly in the project managers hands or 
whoever is maintaining the codebase, you might wonder why that is bad? 
The problem is that the majority of Git users are coders (contributors) 
and what they need most of all is a clean interface which is where Git 
fails to deliver, putting functionality over usability, favoring the 
maintainer over the contributor.</p>

<h2>Git is different but not necessarily better than Mercurial</h2>
<p>It is often said that working with Git is much better then Mercurial.
 The two clearly have pros and cons but one is not necessarily better 
than the other is. It is all depends on your knowledge and expectations.</p>
<ul><li>The method by which both Git and Mercurial handle history, is 
essentially just a directed acyclic graph. However, Mercurial provides 
you with a simple linear history that can cause confusion due to the 
lack of information, whereas Git enables you to follow the history 
backwards but this is complicated and hard to follow, therefore this can
 cause confusion.</li><li>It is often an argument that Git handles branches better than 
Mercurial without any particular reason. As a Mercurial user, you might 
see two branches (named branches and repository clones) and all your 
changes will belong to a named branch. The confusion starts if you have 
many with the same name. Branches structure in Git enables you to avoid 
putting code where you did not want.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Git enforces technical excellence; &#8211; if you do not know everything 
about Git then you should not be using Git else you are a danger to 
others work. Simply put, a Git team is an expert team.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Git is more powerful for larger projects, one good example is the functionality provided by &#8220;partial checkouts&#8221;.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Last, but not least, the biggest non-technical different between 
Mercurial and Git is the marketing. Git seems to be better marketed 
these days and that clearly makes many people use Git.</li></ul>
