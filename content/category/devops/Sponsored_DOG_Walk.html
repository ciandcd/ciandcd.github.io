<p>The DevOpsGuys team are pulling up our hiking socks to raise cash for SSNAP and Countess Mountbatten Hospice this summer with a 13 mile walk across Wales. TrekFest it&#8217;s no mean feat. We cross the highest peaks in the Beacons and South Wales including Pen y Fan (886m), Corn Du (873m), Cribyn (795m) and Fan y Big (719m).&#160;<a href="http://www.trekfest.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.trekfest.org.uk/&#160;</a></p>

<p>Our first charity is special since last year, one of our brave team members was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Unfortunately, and with great sadness we know now they are losing their fight &#8211; even after enduring endless rounds of chemotherapy and surgery.</p>
<p>The amazing staff at Countess Mountbatten Hospice are proving specialist&#160;palliative (end of life) care to many fighting a losing battles against advanced stage cancer. They also support their families and loved ones. We&#8217;d love to show our thanks and support by raising money on their behalf.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s with a tear in our eye and sadness in our hearts, that we chose our second charity to support. Last year, little Ollie lost his fight for his life after being born with a heart defect. He was 4 days old. His parents have displayed so much courage during an immensely difficult time during which the amazing doctors and nurses, support by the SSNAP team provided them with much needed support.</p>
<p>It is their wish to continue to champion SSNAP, who provide support for the sick newborns and their parents at new born intensive care unit at The John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford as so, we&#8217;ll match whatever we raise through our JustGiving page as a donation to SSNAP.</p>
<p><strong>These amazing charities are truly special to us here DevOpsGuys.</strong></p>
<p>Please support us in raising funds for these brilliant charities who have done so much to support our close friends and employees.</p>
<p>The team have signed up to complete the distance in six hours. The trek takes place in the Brecon Beacons and covers the highest peaks in South Wales: Pen y Fan, Corn Du and Fan y Big. The Beacons are a training ground for the SAS so, while the DOGs will have their work cut out for them, they&#8217;re more than up for the challenge:</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to get out there&#8221; says office manager Rhian Owen. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a great opportunity to work together as a team to achieve personal goals and to raise money for good causes &#8211; it&#8217;s going to be brilliant!&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve set up a Just Giving page, so you can show your support here. It&#8217;s a chance to donate to some good causes and get the DevOpsGuys and gals out from behind their screens and into the beautiful Welsh wilderness &#8211; come on y&#8217;all, <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/Dev15/?utm_id=8&amp;fb_action_ids=753124678140173&amp;fb_action_types=jgdonation%3Asupport&amp;fb_ref=pfp-share-facebook-test-B-giving&amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;action_object_map=%5B971301802894069%5D&amp;action_type_map=%5B%22jgdonation%3Asupport%22%5D&amp;action_ref_map=%5B%22pfp-share-facebook-test-B-giving%22%5D">dig deep!</a></p>
