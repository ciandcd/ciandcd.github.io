<p align="center"><a title="Desktop" href="http://sanderstechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Desktop.jpg" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group13773"><img title="Desktop" alt="Desktop" src="http://sanderstechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Desktop_thumb.jpg" border="0" height="443" width="589"></a></p>

<p>The desk is a former QLD police desk from the 1940s, so it wasn&#8217;t built for modern computers &#8211; not a problem, the cables run down the back which is just a minor annoyance.&#160; The keyboard and mouse are gaming varieties so that they perform well &#8211; the old Sennheiser (RF) wireless headset has been with me since 2006 and still works very well.</p>

<p>The wooden clock (<a href="http://sanderstechnology.com/2015/review-olixar-qi-tone-alarm-clock-bluetooth-qi-charging-speaker/13633/" target="_blank">recently reviewed</a>) acts as external speakers, a Bluetooth receiver and has a built in microphone so it can be used as a hands-free option for conference calls.&#160; It also features Qi wireless charging capability and also features a thermostat.</p>

<p>Under the second monitor is a HDD caddy which supports USB3, and features 4 bays which can be used in parallel.&#160; I try to keep the desk reasonably neat, and there&#8217;s plenty of space so it doesn&#8217;t get too cluttered.&#160; I have a nice view out the window to a small courtyard which gets early morning sun.</p>
