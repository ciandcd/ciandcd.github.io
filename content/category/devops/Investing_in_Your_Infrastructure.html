learn what works and doesn&#8217;t websites. The reality of getting out of startup mode and
scaling takes vision and the ability to anticipate how you may need to pivot.
There are two main reasons why startups do not scale. The first is a lack of
experience and mentorship. This is
closely followed by a lack of a working capital.&#160; An effective entrepreneur understands not
only how to pivot but how to utilize capital investment. This article aims to demystify the need for investing in site infrastructure.</p><p>When scaling a business there are several huge issues that
executives tend to forget. whether you are a startup or a fortune 500 company your website is the organizations public face. Maintaining a clean and secure

effective guide customers step by step into a conversion.</p><p>American With Disabilities Act (ADA)</p><p>



</p><p>The ADA can be a freighting legal area for many
entrepreneurs. Many think that ADA only applies to physical boundaries such as
implementing ramps for wheelchairs and accessible bathroom stalls. However this
is far from the case. Few people know that the digital world also counts. Is your website written in HTML5? If not you
are in violation of ADA.&#160; This newest
version of the HTML coding language allows for an audible version of a web site
for those facing impaired vision.&#160;
However there are some quick an easy ways to gain some ADA points to
allow for more leeway in other more long-term solutions. Implementing <a href="http://www.vicaps.com/closed-captioning-services.php">closed captioning</a>
into your promotional videos will allow for increased accessibility for those facing an auditory disability.&#160;</p><p>Investing in infrastructure is not a single step but a
constant to building a good company culture where employees can feel proud of
where they work and remain safe. Please comment on this
