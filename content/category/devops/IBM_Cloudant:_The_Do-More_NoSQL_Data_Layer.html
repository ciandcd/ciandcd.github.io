Cloudant simplifies the development cycle for creators of fast-growing web and mobile applications, by alleviating the burdens of mundane database administration tasks. Developers are then able to focus on building the next generation of systems of engagement &#8211; social and mobile applications &#8211; without losing time, money, or sleep managing their database infrastructure and growth. Critically, Cloudant is an enterprise-ready service that supports this infrastructure with guaranteed performance and availability. Built atop a CouchDB-based NoSQL data layer, Cloudant&#8217;s fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) enables applications and their developers to be more agile. As a part of its data layer, clients have access to multi-master replication and mobile device synchronization capabilities for occasionally connected devices. Applications can take advantage of Cloudant&#8217;s advanced real-time indexing for ad hoc full text search via Apache Lucene, online analytics via MapReduce, and advanced geospatial querying. Mobile applications can use a durable replication protocol for offline sync and global data distribution, as well as a geo-load balancing capability to ensure cross-data center availability and optimal performance. Cloudant&#8217;s RESTful web-based API, flexible schema, and capacity to scale massively are what empower clients to deliver applications to market faster in a cost-effective, DBA-free service model. This IBM Redbooks&#174; Solution Guide describes the IBM Cloudant features.</p>
