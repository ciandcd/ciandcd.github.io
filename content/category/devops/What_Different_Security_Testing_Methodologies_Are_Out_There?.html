    What Different Security Testing Methodologies Are Out There?</title></head><body>From:<a href=http://java.dzone.com/articles/what-different-security>http://java.dzone.com/articles/what-different-security</a><br><br><div><p class="print-link"></p><p>Every business has unique characteristics that set it apart from other organizations, even within the same industry. For this reason, it shouldn't be surprising that there's not a one-size-fits-all approach to app&#160;security&#160;testing. Each company has certain protection expectations and regulations to adhere to, making it essential to find the best way to achieve these goals. Here are a few examples of&#160;<a href="http://www.securityinnovation.com/uploads/security-testing-methodology.pdf">security&#160;testing</a>&#160;methodologies available for quality assurance teams to leverage:<br>
<br>
<strong>Black box</strong><br>
 With black box&#160;testing, QA professionals put themselves in the shoes of the hacker and attempt to break the app through various attack vectors. This methodology can yield a lot of information and help better secure the program from actual threats. A white paper by&#160;Security&#160;Innovation noted that&#160;software&#160;testers&#160;first&#160;analyze the system's architecture and business model&#160;to identify any&#160;security&#160;vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Looking over the software logic in this way can uncover subtle&#160;security&#160;and privacy issues that may not have been noticed otherwise, such as defects in design, input, system dependency, authentication, cryptography and information disclosure.</p>

<p>"Although white box code inspection is good for analyzing static behavior, only black box exploratory&#160;testing&#160;can determine the dynamic behavior of how a system is implemented and used, the coupling between systems and the interactions of the distributed systems,"&#160;Security&#160;Innovation wrote.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic</strong><br>
 For QA teams that like to execute code, dynamic&#160;testing&#160;is the approach for them. This methodology checks the running application for how it behaves and responds to a variety of inputs. This is done to ensure that the product meets up with established regulations and is giving the expected outcomes. IBM noted that dynamic analysis is especially&#160;useful to identify code coverage, as it can discover bugs in paths that have gone untested. While dynamic&#160;testing&#160;can be manual work for testers, it can also yield significant information that will help mitigate defects and produce quality products.</p>

<p><strong>Static</strong><br>
 In contrast to dynamic&#160;testing, static approaches directly review&#160;the source code, often through an automated&#160;<a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/products">test management solution</a>. TechTarget contributor Michael Cobb noted that this methodology occurs at the implementation phase, rather than when the app is running, and often helps&#160;mitigate vulnerabilities involved with industry compliance standards. Automation in this area can reduce the amount of time it takes to complete these tasks. However, it may not be able to detect sophisticated threats, which can be supplemented by dynamic&#160;<a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/Software-testing-methodologies-Dynamic-versus-static-application-security-testing">security&#160;testing</a>.</p>

<p>"A thorough source code review has an advantage over dynamic&#160;testing," Cobb wrote. "Nothing is hidden from analysts during a source code review, so they can examine exactly how data flows through a program. By solving the problem at the code level, static&#160;testing&#160;reduces the number of&#160;security-related design and coding defects, and the severity of any defects that make it through to the release version, thus dramatically improving the overall&#160;security&#160;of the application."</p>

<p>There are a number of&#160;security&#160;testing&#160;methodologies that organizations can pursue, and designing a combination of approaches may result with a solution that's best for their needs. Using these strategies, companies can better ensure the protection of sensitive information while providing users with the&#160;<a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/sites/default/files/content/resources/Test%20Management%20Solution%20Buyer%27s%20Guide.pdf">software testing&#160;tools</a>&#160;needed to succeed.</p>
