<p>Last week the DevOpsGuys headed up to Newport&#8217;s Celtic Manor to take part in Digital 2015 &#8211; the Welsh Government&#8217;s initiative to bring digital innovators and business professionals together. The 2-day event saw more than 2,000 delegates and 140 speakers.</p>
<p>DevOpsGuy co-founder Steve Thair says:</p>
<p>&#8220;These initiatives are invaluable to the digital sector because they expose the wide variety of digital and technological services that are available in South Wales to business professionals who can use them to take online business services to the next level. It&#8217;s a relaxed environment where people can chat and form connections that will have a direct impact on the future of business and technology in Wales.&#8221;</p>
<p>The diverse range of speakers at the event included Microsoft, the WRU, Amazon and the DVLA. The opportunity to discuss the needs of businesses directly with those running them is invaluable. This dialogue can lead to collaborative projects and further development of the burgeoning tech industry in the area.</p>
<p>The team are excited to see more events like this one springing up in the near future. Look out for us at the up-coming Agile Cymru in the Wales Millennium Centre on the 7th and 8th of July.</p>
