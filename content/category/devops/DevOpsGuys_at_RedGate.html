<p>The DevOpsGuys headed off on a road trip this week to meet with the RedGate team at their amazing offices in Cambridge.</p>
<p>As well as working on some workshop training opportunities and guest blog articles (stay tuned to the DevOpsGuys Blog for some RedGate articles coming soon) the teams got together to brainstorm ideas and share skills.</p>
<p>We were able to look at some of their newest tools and we&#8217;re excited to announce that we will be delivering workshops on RedGate DLM tools at various sessions across the country this summer.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already implemented these tools for a many of our&#160;customers and we&#8217;re delighted to be able to introduce their qualities, in detail, to a wide range of industry professionals as part of an effective, independent DevOps adoption process.</p>
<p><strong>The workshops will be running on:</strong></p>
<p>May 20 &#8211; Automated Database Deployment, London</p>
<p>June 26 &#8211;&#160;Automated Database Deployment, Belfast</p>
