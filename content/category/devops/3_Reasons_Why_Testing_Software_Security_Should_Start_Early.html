If even one element is neglected, it can delay project schedules and affect user performance. Security is one <a href="https://www.getzephyr.com/products/enterprise-test-management/zephyr-enterprise-edition">aspect that must be built in</a> from the inception of any app, and here are a few reasons&#160;why:</p>

<p><strong>Breaches can cost&#160;your business</strong><br>
 Let's say that an organization uses its application&#160;to&#160;order and manage inventory, payroll and other operational&#160;needs. If a malicious entity were&#160;to&#160;access this information, it could easily make fraudulent transactions, costing the company more than what was intended. Not&#160;to&#160;mention it will create a massive headache&#160;to&#160;set the record straight. TechTarget contributor Peter Gregory noted that this can happen when&#160;<a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/tip/Security-in-the-software-development-life-cycle" target="_blank">programs lack audit trails</a>&#160;and processes required for secure purchasing. By building in this functionality early on, this type of situation can be avoided, allowing organizations&#160;to&#160;retain customer trust and money.</p>

<p>"Organizations that fail&#160;to&#160;involve information security in the life cycle will pay the price in the form of costly and disruptive events," Gregory wrote. "Many bad things can happen&#160;to&#160;information systems that lack the required security interfaces and characteristics."</p>

<p><strong>Access&#160;to&#160;confidential data can be damaging</strong><br>
 If a business aims&#160;to&#160;use an app for information sharing and availability, protection must be at the forefront of this project throughout its life cycle. While some data may not be as costly&#160;to&#160;leak, the&#160;loss&#160;of confidential reports and documents can severely affect the organization's ability&#160;tofunction.</p>

<p>QA teams must ensure that security practices are implemented and built upon constantly. TechTarget contributor Nick Lewis noted that&#160;<a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-negate-business-logic-attack-risk-Improve-security-in-the-SDLC" target="_blank">firewalls and traditional methods will not be enough</a>&#160;to&#160;keep targeted attacks at bay. Instead, testing the app for insufficient process validation, abuse of functionality, weak password recovery validation and information leakage will be critical&#160;toguarding the program.</p>

<p><strong>Analyze&#160;initial risk before jumping in</strong><br>
 One SDLC security practice&#160;to&#160;observe is a primary risk assessment before the start of a new project. Not all applications are equal, which means each program will be labeled with a different risk level. Some software will be publicly accessible, whereas others will be more business-critical and involve processing sensitive data. These uses will largely determine how much risk would be involved with a breach on such activities. This information will give QA teams a clear picture of the security roadmap&#160;needed, and can be implemented.&#160;</p>

<p>"Doing the preliminary risk assessment&#160;to&#160;establish the&#160;need&#160;for the system helps&#160;<a href="http://software-security.sans.org/resources/paper/cissp/defining-understanding-security-software-development-life-cycle" target="_blank">identify any security show stoppers</a>&#160;before&#160;too much time and effort goes into the next SDLC phases," a SANS white paper stated. "It also gets the design team thinking about security issues early in the design process."</p>

<p>Cyberattacks and malware in the headlines have made security more prominent than ever before. By building in protections early in the SDLC, QA teams can ensure that they will be better able&#160;tohandle these threats without interruptions&#160;to&#160;regular business activities.</p>
