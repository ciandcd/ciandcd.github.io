With 285 respondents representing a wide range of organizations, it shows that Containers will be part of many production environments in the very near future.</p>
<p>Currently, only 38 percent of respondents reported using containers in production environments, but that number is projected to increase 69 percent over the next 12 months as organizations find new ways to address important barriers to adoption. It verified that Docker is overwhelmingly the container of choice, with 92% of respondents having used or investigated it, followed by LXC (32%) a distant second, but still far ahead of Rocket (21%). To access the complete survey and report visit&#160;<a href="https://clusterhq.com/assets/pdfs/state-of-container-usage-june-2015.pdf">https://clusterhq.com/assets/pdfs/state-of-container-usage-june-2015.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Companies ranging in size from small organizations with 1 to 500 employees (69%), to mid-size companies with 501-2,500 personnel (12%), all the way up to large enterprises with over 2,500 employees (19%) are represented in the survey. This demonstrates that containers are being embraced by all businesses from the startup stage to Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Respondents came predominantly from Development, Operations and DevOps teams. QA and security teams were a smaller share. The survey revealed how container technologies are being used today, as well as research-based insights while providing clues as to where the industry is trending.</p>
<p>From the ClusterHQ release on the survey:</p>
<p>The survey also revealed insights into what is perceived to be the primary barriers to container adoption. Security seems to be emerging as a consistent concern throughout the DevOps community in these times of never ending breaches throughout the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security &#8212; 61%</li>
<li>Data Management &#8212; 53%</li>
<li>Networking &#8212; 51%</li>
<li>Skills and Knowledge &#8212; 48%</li>
<li>Persistent Storage &#8212; 48%</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Management capabilities also emerged as essential to the success of container strategies and that the vast majority of organizations want to run databases as well as additional services in containers.</p>
<ul>
<li>When asked to rate how important data management&#160;is to container strategies, 66 percent reported it as a critical or&#160;important gating factor, 29 percent ranked it as moderately important and&#160;only 5 percent reported that it carries no importance.</li>
<li>Over 70% of respondents said they would like to&#160;run a database or other stateful service in their container&#160;environments.</li>
<li>Respondents were also asked which specific features of&#160;container data management they considered to be most important, selecting&#160;the &#8220;integration of data management capabilities into existing container&#160;workflows and tools&#8221; as their first choice, with &#8220;seamless&#160;movement of data between dev, test and production environments&#8221; a&#160;close second.</li>
<li>MySQL (53%), Redis (52%), PostgreSQL (50%), and&#160;Elasticsearch (43%) were reported as the top four most frequently used&#160;stateful services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Containers have become known for portability and flexibility, the survey reveals that organizations are using them in different infrastructures but most frequently in on-premises data centers (57%), followed by Amazon Web Services (52%).</p>
<p>So I think it is safe to say Containers are rapidly becoming one of the staples of development and are here to stay to stay in the foreseeable future.</p>
