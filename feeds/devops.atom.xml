If that is true I guess the folks over Informa Telecoms and Media Ltd are very, very sincere. Why else would they change the name of their DevOps Conference from &amp;#8220;DevOps Summit&amp;#8221; (which name they &amp;#8220;borrowed&amp;#8221; from the Sys-Con folks) to DevOps Connect Europe. &amp;#160;No matter that we here at DevOps.com have already held several events in Europe and London specifically with our DevOps Connect name. No matter that we have a website and own the domain &lt;a href="http://www.devopsconnect.co" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.devopsconnect.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Why shouldn&amp;#8217;t they just use our name and employ the &amp;#8220;colorful&amp;#8221; technique of registering a hyphenated play on the domain name? I guess that alone should tell you all you need to know about this company and the events they produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course we can go hire some International copyright attorneys and litigate first usage and ask for injunctions and damages. But why bother? I am a big believer in letting the market be the judge, jury and executioner. &amp;#160;I am perfectly fine with using DevOps.com to get out the word about these kinds of business practices and letting the market act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event these people want to put on will probably be no better than the several DevOps Summit events they put on previously. I have heard from exhibitors, speakers and attendees of those events that they were less than successful. Mind you I haven&amp;#8217;t attended any, just reporting on what I was told. Ultimately though if they were successful they wouldn&amp;#8217;t be trying to rebrand using someone else&amp;#8217;s name. &amp;#160;Hard to argue with that logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am asking our readers (and there are many of you in London, &amp;#160;as it is our single biggest city for viewers) to let this company know that copying others business names will not stand. The best way to do this is to not attend, don&amp;#8217;t participate and get the word out that this is not the way business is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t be fooled by the attempt to piggyback our brand and success, we have nothing to do with that event. In fact we will be holding several DevOps Connect events in London and elsewhere in Europe in the fall. &amp;#160;Details will be announced shortly but there will be lots of opportunities to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may ask, &amp;#8220;you haven&amp;#8217;t given us the link to this event?&amp;#8221; You&amp;#8217;re right, I have not and for good reason. I have already given this company and their event more ink than they are probably due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So be aware of imitators, remember there is only one DevOps Connect and those are the events put on by us at DevOps.com. We hope to see you at them and will be sure to let everyone know when we do. Until then don&amp;#8217;t reward imitators.&lt;/p&gt;

We interject some automation, make the two halves work closer together, get some feedback loops going and go as fast as we can. But lets look at those first two steps in the diagram, the ones labeled consult and design. What and how do we accomplish this? There is a company called &lt;a href="http://www.irise.com"&gt;iRise &lt;/a&gt;that has built a great business by allowing for rapidly visualizing and defining requirements for building applications. It is high time we recognize this as the important piece of the puzzle that it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had a chance to meet with some of the executive team of iRise while I was in London for the CD Summit. &amp;#160;The premise of iRise is so simple I was thinking to myself, &amp;#8220;why hasn&amp;#8217;t anyone else thought of this?&amp;#8221; &amp;#160;If the old adage of crap in is crap out is true, why wouldn&amp;#8217;t we take the time to define and plan our software better early on? I know everyone thinks they do, but do they really? Do we quickly visualize to help define the requirements and to help the team buy in and sign off? If it is set up right to begin with, it flows a lot faster later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the folks at Tasktop creators of the&amp;#160;Eclipse&amp;#160;Mylyn open source tool &lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150625005349/en/Tasktop-iRise-Announce-OEM-Partnership"&gt;have teamed&lt;/a&gt; with iRise to OEM iRise into the Tasktop Software Lifecycle Integration system. In speaking with Stephen Brickley, EVP of iRise, he thinks this partnership will be a key factor in bringing iRise into the mainstream DevOps tools market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRise&amp;#8217;s customers, like software departments everywhere are adopting new ways of developing and operating software. New times and new ways don&amp;#8217;t mean that you throw out what works though. To me it is a no brainer. If you have a tool that lets you quickly visualize, prototype and communicate to the rest of the team before investing a lot of effort into development, it really has to help. &amp;#160;It is the ultimate shift left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the issue is how quickly can you do this without adding extra steps to the development process. From what I saw of iRise it makes it really easy and fast. Of course I would be interested to hear from anyone who has used iRise or even a similar tool on your own experience. But if it all is as it seems, I would expect iRise to be a welcome addition to the DevOps toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? What tool do you use for this now or do you just skip this in planning and initial requirements? We are always on the lookout for new tools to report on at DevOps.com, but ultimately we depend on our readers to tell us what is really useful or not. &amp;#160;So let us know.&lt;/p&gt;

For this reason, it shouldn't be surprising that there's not a one-size-fits-all approach to app&amp;#160;security&amp;#160;testing. Each company has certain protection expectations and regulations to adhere to, making it essential to find the best way to achieve these goals. Here are a few examples of&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.securityinnovation.com/uploads/security-testing-methodology.pdf"&gt;security&amp;#160;testing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;methodologies available for quality assurance teams to leverage:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Black box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 With black box&amp;#160;testing, QA professionals put themselves in the shoes of the hacker and attempt to break the app through various attack vectors. This methodology can yield a lot of information and help better secure the program from actual threats. A white paper by&amp;#160;Security&amp;#160;Innovation noted that&amp;#160;software&amp;#160;testers&amp;#160;first&amp;#160;analyze the system's architecture and business model&amp;#160;to identify any&amp;#160;security&amp;#160;vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking over the software logic in this way can uncover subtle&amp;#160;security&amp;#160;and privacy issues that may not have been noticed otherwise, such as defects in design, input, system dependency, authentication, cryptography and information disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Although white box code inspection is good for analyzing static behavior, only black box exploratory&amp;#160;testing&amp;#160;can determine the dynamic behavior of how a system is implemented and used, the coupling between systems and the interactions of the distributed systems,"&amp;#160;Security&amp;#160;Innovation wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 For QA teams that like to execute code, dynamic&amp;#160;testing&amp;#160;is the approach for them. This methodology checks the running application for how it behaves and responds to a variety of inputs. This is done to ensure that the product meets up with established regulations and is giving the expected outcomes. IBM noted that dynamic analysis is especially&amp;#160;useful to identify code coverage, as it can discover bugs in paths that have gone untested. While dynamic&amp;#160;testing&amp;#160;can be manual work for testers, it can also yield significant information that will help mitigate defects and produce quality products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 In contrast to dynamic&amp;#160;testing, static approaches directly review&amp;#160;the source code, often through an automated&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/products"&gt;test management solution&lt;/a&gt;. TechTarget contributor Michael Cobb noted that this methodology occurs at the implementation phase, rather than when the app is running, and often helps&amp;#160;mitigate vulnerabilities involved with industry compliance standards. Automation in this area can reduce the amount of time it takes to complete these tasks. However, it may not be able to detect sophisticated threats, which can be supplemented by dynamic&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/Software-testing-methodologies-Dynamic-versus-static-application-security-testing"&gt;security&amp;#160;testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A thorough source code review has an advantage over dynamic&amp;#160;testing," Cobb wrote. "Nothing is hidden from analysts during a source code review, so they can examine exactly how data flows through a program. By solving the problem at the code level, static&amp;#160;testing&amp;#160;reduces the number of&amp;#160;security-related design and coding defects, and the severity of any defects that make it through to the release version, thus dramatically improving the overall&amp;#160;security&amp;#160;of the application."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of&amp;#160;security&amp;#160;testing&amp;#160;methodologies that organizations can pursue, and designing a combination of approaches may result with a solution that's best for their needs. Using these strategies, companies can better ensure the protection of sensitive information while providing users with the&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/sites/default/files/content/resources/Test%20Management%20Solution%20Buyer%27s%20Guide.pdf"&gt;software testing&amp;#160;tools&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;needed to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

 Mecurial and GIT, is better and why? This is an old argument, with 
forum posts galore about which is better; with users of both arguing 
their case, however this argument never seems to be resolved. This is 
because the feature sets are so similar, and after researching the 
various strengths and weaknesses it became clear that they both have 
clear advantages for certain situations, &amp;#8211; different use cases. Below we
 have listed both pros and cons for both Git and Mercurial in order for 
our readers to be able to make their own decision as to what is best for
 them, after all user requirements and team requirements differ; there 
is no one size fits all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commonly found comments about Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIT is overly complex in every sense of the word, in particular the 
information model and the command line syntax as well as the help 
documentation, none of it is easy to understand. The statement &amp;#8220;if you 
don&amp;#8217;t understand the functionality don&amp;#8217;t use it, just use it like 
subversion&amp;#8221; just doesn&amp;#8217;t fit for the simple reason that most commands 
lead to further commands, where simple actions can require complex 
actions to undo or refine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision as to whether to use Git on a development project or 
not, is primarily a question of how knowledgeable of Git the individuals
 are within the team, a single weak link can bring down the entire team.
 The obvious example of this is seen in the version control of Git. It 
is simply put, &amp;#8211; unsafe, &amp;#8211; prone to accidental alteration by users 
(potentially affecting the entire team), therefore a high minimum 
knowledge requirement is necessary. Consider a Git test, what should the
 pass rate be? 70%, 80% or 90%?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on the overly complex nature of Git&amp;#8217;s design, the obvious 
point is that it puts control firmly in the project managers hands or 
whoever is maintaining the codebase, you might wonder why that is bad? 
The problem is that the majority of Git users are coders (contributors) 
and what they need most of all is a clean interface which is where Git 
fails to deliver, putting functionality over usability, favoring the 
maintainer over the contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/git_mercurial_pros_cons-intland-software.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14944" src="http://intland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/git_mercurial_pros_cons-intland-software-336x850.png" alt="Pors and Cons of Git and Mercurial" width="336" height="850"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Git is different but not necessarily better than Mercurial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often said that working with Git is much better then Mercurial.
 The two clearly have pros and cons but one is not necessarily better 
than the other is. It is all depends on your knowledge and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The method by which both Git and Mercurial handle history, is 
essentially just a directed acyclic graph. However, Mercurial provides 
you with a simple linear history that can cause confusion due to the 
lack of information, whereas Git enables you to follow the history 
backwards but this is complicated and hard to follow, therefore this can
 cause confusion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is often an argument that Git handles branches better than 
Mercurial without any particular reason. As a Mercurial user, you might 
see two branches (named branches and repository clones) and all your 
changes will belong to a named branch. The confusion starts if you have 
many with the same name. Branches structure in Git enables you to avoid 
putting code where you did not want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Git enforces technical excellence; &amp;#8211; if you do not know everything 
about Git then you should not be using Git else you are a danger to 
others work. Simply put, a Git team is an expert team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Git is more powerful for larger projects, one good example is the functionality provided by &amp;#8220;partial checkouts&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last, but not least, the biggest non-technical different between 
Mercurial and Git is the marketing. Git seems to be better marketed 
these days and that clearly makes many people use Git.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Even so, there were a few interesting surprises. Among them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Bi-modal is big. Not everyone will succeed.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/2014/06/18/gartneriom/"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright wp-image-23343" src="https://blog.newrelic.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_138783362-300x216.jpg" alt=" gartner IT summit" width="200" height="144"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/2014/06/18/gartneriom/"&gt;Gartner continued to tell its customers to employ two modes of IT&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;a traditional, slower moving capability for older, typically internal systems of record; and a high-speed, experimental one for new, typically customer-facing Web and mobile apps. &amp;#8220;This is a time of experimentation and innovation,&amp;#8221; said Gartner VP and distinguished analyst&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/analyst/37125/Chris-Howard" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Howard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;in his opening keynote. Organizations can&amp;#8217;t ignore that there are multiple speeds and they should participate in all. Gartner managing VP&lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/analyst/6971/Ronni-J.-Colville" target="_blank"&gt;Ronni Colville&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;added that by 2017, 75% of IT orgs will have this &amp;#8220;bi-modal&amp;#8221; IT capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/2014/06/18/gartneriom/"&gt;Bi-Modal IT: Gartner Endorses Both Disruptive and Conservative Approaches to Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &amp;#8220;50% will make a mess of it,&amp;#8221; Colville said. Why? Not necessarily because of technology failings, but more often because of a lack of people skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. IT success is all about people.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/analyst/7159" target="_blank"&gt;Donna Scott&lt;/a&gt;, also a Gartner VP and distinguished analyst, told her keynote audience that &amp;#8220;you will be judged on agility, speed, and innovation.&amp;#8221; However, the biggest problems Gartner sees for infrastructure and operations team engagement and innovation are lack of time, company culture that&amp;#8217;s not conducive to these approaches, and a lack of business skills in IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of the people responding to an in-room poll said &amp;#8220;people&amp;#8221; are the part of IT ops that must change first. Not technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignleft wp-image-23348" src="https://blog.newrelic.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_242472601-1.jpg" alt="business team" width="250" height="178"&gt;Gartner research director&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/analyst/38065" target="_blank"&gt;George Spafford&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;underscored similar issues in large organizations trying to use DevOps at scale: people and &amp;#8220;human factors&amp;#8221; are the biggest concerns from his in-room poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these probably contributed to hiring best-selling author&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.danpink.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Pink&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;as a keynote speaker on the opening day of the conference. His focus? Not IT or architecture. Instead, he pounded home the importance of influencing people and selling internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Big orgs are trying DevOps. But the issues are different at scale.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In numerous sessions I saw many hands go up when analysts asked, &amp;#8220;Who here is trying DevOps?&amp;#8221; Clearly, the approach is getting traction in large companies. But there&amp;#8217;s lots of learning still to do. In fact, that was Spafford&amp;#8217;s biggest bit of advice. &amp;#8220;Always be learning,&amp;#8221; he said, &amp;#8220;trying to see what works and what breaks, especially at scale.&amp;#8221; And, even once you&amp;#8217;ve had some initial success, keep learning. &amp;#8220;If you&amp;#8217;ve done &amp;#8234;DevOps, stay humble,&amp;#8221; he advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Looking to innovative organizations for ideas &amp;#8230; analytics on the rise.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many sessions addressed how large organizations are taking on ideas fostered by smaller, more risk-tolerant companies, and offered advice for doing so successfully. In addition to multiple discussions of DevOps, an entire session was devoted to establishing your own &amp;#8220;Genius Bar&amp;#174;&amp;#8212;a &amp;#8220;walk-up IT support center&amp;#8221; as&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.cio.com/article/2387321/byod/killing-the-help-desk-softly---or-blowing-it-up.html" target="_blank"&gt;explained in this&amp;#160;CIO&amp;#160;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As at previous conferences, Gartner research VP&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/analyst/18444/Cameron-Haight" target="_blank"&gt;Cameron Haight&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;ran several sessions on lessons learned from firms running massive, Web-scale IT systems. &amp;#8220;You need lots of data &amp;#8230; and access to it inexpensively,&amp;#8221; he said. Some commercial monitoring companies (New Relic included!) got a shout out for taking the lessons of Web scale IT to heart in their offerings. In addition, Haight said, &amp;#8220;Analytics are increasingly important for application performance monitoring given the huge amount of data now available.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Cloud: Enterprises want it, but aren&amp;#8217;t very good at it yet.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gartner research director&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/analyst/50140" target="_blank"&gt;Dennis Smith&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;talked through the enterprise&amp;#8217;s interest in cloud computing. A huge majority of his in-room poll wanted some mix of both public and private cloud, while only 9% wanted to use&amp;#160;only&amp;#160;a private cloud environment and a measly 4% were looking to move entirely to the public cloud. The most popular choice (41%) was an 80/20 split between private and public cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Enterprises don&amp;#8217;t make the dean&amp;#8217;s list,&amp;#8221; for cloud usage, Smith said, earning no more than a C average in his opinion. Large organizations are doing well at visibility, governance, and delivering standardized stacks, he said, but are less skilled at optimizing for these new environments. Still, Smith said the trends point toward enterprises improving on all fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Cloud security can be better than yours.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Gartner VP and distinguished analyst&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/analyst/7299/Neil-MacDonald" target="_blank"&gt;Neil MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;gave the cloud a vote of confidence: noting that, for a variety of reasons, &amp;#8220;Well-managed public cloud can be more secure than your own data center.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, on-premise software can pose serious security risks, he said, because of &amp;#8220;deployment lag&amp;#8221; where customers are stuck using software releases with unpatched security vulnerabilities. With a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), security updates can be more quickly rolled out to all customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignright wp-image-22350" src="https://blog.newrelic.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_170472269-300x225.jpg" alt=" gartner IT summit" width="250" height="188"&gt;But cloud security can be different, requiring a shift to information-level security from OS-level security. Best practices include doing away with a huge pool of all-powerful sysadmins in favor of JEA, or &amp;#8220;just enough administration,&amp;#8221; where sysadmins have just enough privileges to do their job, and no more. An analogous security practice for compute resources is &amp;#8220;least privilege,&amp;#8221; where apps and microservices can&amp;#8217;t talk to each other unless they specifically need to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audience polling supported MacDonald&amp;#8217;s optimistic view of cloud security, which suggests that large enterprises may struggle less with their cloud policies moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Containers: Try &amp;#8217;em!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of this week&amp;#8217;s&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.dockercon.com/" target="_blank"&gt;DockerCon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;in San Francisco, Gartner devoted significant airtime to educating the audience on containers and microservices. My summary of &amp;#8234;Gartner VP and distinguished analyst&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/analyst/7030/Thomas-J.-Bittman" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Bittman&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;advice on containers was simple: Try &amp;#8217;em. Now. Complement them with VMs. &amp;#8234;And Docker (the company) is important, but not the be-all and end-all in this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bittman (copping to some deja vu from Gartner presentations he made on server virtualization 13 years ago) noted that while virtualization has been focused on admin and ops functions, containers are focused on value for developers. But because containers are well suited for driving up VM utilization for workloads that share the same OS, we can expect to see more combinations of containers and server virtualization. Finally, Bittman underscored that Gartner doesn&amp;#8217;t see containers having much impact on premise, but making a huge difference in the cloud. That doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily fit with what&amp;#8217;s been shown in other research, such as this&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://stackengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Docker-Adoption-Survey-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;2015 State of Containers Survey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;sponsored by VMblog.com and StackEngine, so we&amp;#8217;ll want to watch how this plays out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all a lot to digest. The&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/summits/na/it-operations/index.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;Gartner IT Operations Strategies &amp;amp; Solutions Summit&lt;/a&gt;acknowledges the importance of dealing with existing IT systems and practices as well as promising new technologies and thinking, and tries to point a way forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Haight had a very good quote about microservices that I thought also served to wrap up the entire event: &amp;#8220;If you want to run with the big dogs, you need to rethink application architecture,&amp;#8221; he said. That can be very difficult for an enterprise to fully implement &amp;#8230; but also very appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note:&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/author/alsargent/"&gt;Al Sargent&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;contributed to this post.&amp;#160;All product and company names herein may be trademarks of their registered owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-141093412/stock-photo-closeup-on-data-servers-while-working-blue-led-lights-are-flashing-image-can-represent-cloud.html" target="_blank"&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-138783362.html" target="_blank"&gt;tortoise and hare&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-242472601.html" target="_blank"&gt;business team&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-170472269.html" target="_blank"&gt;cloud security&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;images courtesy of&lt;a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But I&amp;#8217;ll extend on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blue-green deployment is one where there is an &amp;#8220;active&amp;#8221; and a &amp;#8220;spare&amp;#8221; set of servers. The active running the current version, and the spare being ready to run any newly deployed version. The &amp;#8220;active&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;spare&amp;#8221; is slightly different than &amp;#8220;blue&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221;, because one set is always &amp;#8220;blue&amp;#8221; and one is always &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221;, while the &amp;#8220;active&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;spare&amp;#8221; labels change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On AWS, for example, you can script the deployment by having two child stacks of your main stacks &amp;#8211; active and spare (indicated by a stack label), each having one (or more) auto-scaling group for your application layer, and a script that does the following (applicable to non-AWS as well):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;push build to an accessible location (e.g. s3)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;set the spare auto-scaling group size to the desired value (the spare stays at 0 when not used)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;make it fetch the pushed build on startup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wait for it to start&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;run sanity tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;switch DNS to point to an ELB in front of the spare ASG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;switch the labels to make the spare one active and vice versa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;set the previously active ASG size to 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://techblog.bozho.net/state-does-not-belong-in-the-code/"&gt;application layer is stateless&lt;/a&gt;, so it&amp;#8217;s easy to do hot-replaces like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But (as Fowler indicated) the database is the most tricky component. If you have 2 databases, where the spare one is a slave replica of the active one (and that changes every time you switch), the setup becomes more complicated. And you&amp;#8217;ll still have to do schema changes. So using a single database, if possible, is the easier approach, regardless of whether you have a &amp;#8220;regular&amp;#8221; database or a schemaless one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it boils down to having your application modify the database on startup, in a way that works with both versions. This includes schema changes &amp;#8211; table (or the relevant term in the schemaless db) creation, field addition/removal and inserting new data (e.g. enumerations). And it can go wrong in many ways, depending on the data and datatypes. Some nulls, some datatype change that makes a few values unparseable, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&amp;#8217;s harder to do it with a regular SQL database. As suggested in the post I linked earlier, you can use stored procedures (which I don&amp;#8217;t like), or you can use a&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://techblog.bozho.net/database-migrations-and-java/"&gt;database migration tool&lt;/a&gt;. For a schemaless database you must do stuff manually, but but fewer actions are normally needed &amp;#8211; you don&amp;#8217;t have to alter tables or explicitly create new ones, as everything is handled automatically. And the most important thing is to not break the running version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how to make sure everything works?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;test on staging &amp;#8211; preferably with a replica of the production database&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(automatically) run your behaviour/acceptance/sanity test suites against the not-yet-active new deployment before switching the DNS to point to it. Stop the process if they fail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only after these checks pass, switch the DNS and point your domain to the previously spare group, thus promoting it to &amp;#8220;active&amp;#8221;. Switching can be done manually, or automatically with the deployment script. The &amp;#8220;switch&amp;#8221; can be other than a DNS one (as you need a low TTL for that). It can be a load-balancer or a subnet configuration, for example &amp;#8211; the best option depends on your setup. And while it is good to automate everything, having a few manual steps isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#8217;d recommend the blue-green deployment approach in order to achieve zero downtime upgrades. But always make sure your database is properly upgraded, so that it works with both the old and the new version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been set up in Cardiff, South Wales for nearly six months now. Every week it becomes more and more apparent that this city is fast becoming an exciting IT and technical hub; an attractive area for emerging and experienced tech talent alike. The term &amp;#8216;Silicwm Valley&amp;#8217; is being bandied about as more and more tech start-ups spring up in, or near, the city centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like DevOpsGuys, Cardiff Start, Indycube, Method 4, BBC Cymru&amp;#8217;s Roath Lock studios and a huge collection of digital and design agencies are choosing Cardiff as their base. It seems to be a logical step; the community is small enough to be interconnected, influential and supportive, but large enough to allow for the freedom to develop, expand and learn from the huge range of related industries in the immediate area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With several major universities in and around the city the wealth of talent is growing and Cardiff is taking the reins and nurturing Welsh talent and ability; a very different picture from several years ago where work in Wales was hard to come by and the majority of experienced IT professionals were obliged to seek work further afield, in London or Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founder James Smith says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Cardiff has historically been built on industry, from the days of exporting coal. It&amp;#8217;s also frequently voted one of the top places to live and work in the UK, so it&amp;#8217;s no wonder that this tradition is developing and changing shape with the emergence of the tech industry &amp;#8211; Cardiff is moving with the times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve set up DevOpsGuys in Cardiff in order to be a part of this development. We wanted to provide opportunities for people in Wales &amp;#8211; there&amp;#8217;s so much skill here. Plus we are working with international companies and forming partnerships with industry giants across the world; this is a great opportunity to share some of the home-grown Welsh talent, create unique, fulfilling career opportunities and forge connections all over the world. It&amp;#8217;s a really exciting time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement has been supported by the Welsh Government, with DevOpsGuys receiving &amp;#160;funding to grow as a business and provide career opportunities in the Welsh capital. Meet-ups, tech events, talks and conferences all taking place in the city, give related, but wildly diverse businesses a chance to meet, mix, talk, share thoughts; ideas flow freely, business connections are forged easily and some new and interesting work is emerging. We&amp;#8217;re excited about &lt;a href="http://blog.devopsguys.com/2015/04/16/the-first-2-day-agile-conference-to-hit-cardiff/"&gt;Agile Cymru&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; the first event of its kind in Cardiff&amp;#160;&amp;#8211; this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be something new to see, do, read, visit, look at or enjoy every week! We&amp;#8217;re excited to see where Cardiff will take the DevOpsGuys and the future of the UK tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn't too painful but not quite as straight forward as I hoped either so I thought it was worth writing an article about my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of the code which I've got working, so feel free to start from there. &amp;#160;Click on the link on my website post to download (it should anchor so that the zip file link is at the top of the page)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aplossystems.co.uk/article/create-a-maven-archetype.aplos?content_id=1&amp;amp;cp_id=28#example-archetype" target=""&gt;Link to zip&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found it easiest to create a Java Project and copy the files into there and then convert the project to Maven project but whatever takes your fancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Using property names&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hard part of creating the archetype was getting the property names to show throughout the code. I had followed instructions on other websites that had mentioned the __my-property-name__ convention to get this to work. However after following the instructions on the&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-creating-archetypes.html"&gt;Maven website&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;I found that updating the files from the resulting project didn't work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After some more searching I found out about the archetype-metadata.xml file which appears to be quite important. Once this was added into the system I found that my property names started resolving to their expected values. It also gave me an opportunity to add additional parameters like the projectName used in the example. I found that if you want to place property names in a filename or directory name then you needed to use the __my-property-name__ convention but inside the file you need to use the ${my-property-name} convention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The archetype-metadata.xml file also meant that I could do away with the archetype.xml file that was suggested in the Maven tutorial. With this file you had to say exactly which files you wanted to include into your project, however by specifying **/* for the include tag of the archetype-metadata.xml file it included all of the files inside that folder without having to update the config each time the files changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Velocity and If Statements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maven archetype build uses the velocity templating engine which means that you have a lot of control over what you can do. I'm not going to go through all the details of what Velocity does as there's a perfectly good website for that&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I will have a quick chat about is the if statement functionality. This is really powerful as I had initially started creating seperate archetypes depending on the type of project I was creating. I then quickly realised that a lot of these shared the same structure and files so managed to merge most of them together into a single archetype by using a mix of a new project type required parameter (as mentioned about above) and the velocity if statement. An example of the statement is shown below, the keyword #else can also be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#if( ${projectType} == "cms" || ${projectType} == "ecommerce" ) 
	private int myNewVariable;
#end
					&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adding empty folders&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one had me stuck for a little while as I was trying to add empty folders into the archetype-resources section but they were not appearing in the generated project. The answer is to include them as a fileset in the archetype-metadata.xml as I have done in the example archetype with the "/src/main/webapp" folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;fileSet filtered="true" encoding="UTF-8"&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;src/main/webapp&amp;lt;/directory&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/fileSet&amp;gt;
					&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create a project from the archetype&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use Eclipse as my development environment, if you are using NetBeans or others I imagine this part will be slightly different. In order to create the archetype from the project it was simply a case of right clicking the POM file and choosing to run Maven install.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creating a new project from the archetype however was slightly more tricky as when you go to choose the archetype from the list it's not there. I had to add an archetype using the 'Add Archetype' button on the page where you would normally select the archetype from the list. For the example I just put in com.aplos for the Archetype Group Id, example-archetype for the Archetype Artifact Id and 1.0 for the Version, I left the repository url field blank and Eclipse found the archetype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following these steps should allow you to create a wide range of project structures and base files. I still cannot see how to populate the group id and package name for the project to the default of com.aplos. However I'm happy for now and if I learn the other parts I'll be sure to update this article, or if you know I'd be grateful to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

Gareth anticipates that &amp;#8220;In five years time we will look back on this and ask &amp;#8216;why were we not always doing this&amp;#8217;?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then caught up with&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/helenjbeal"&gt;Helen Beal&lt;/a&gt;, Head of DevOps at Ranger4, where she discussed the importance of DevOps and security. &amp;#160;While the two ultimately need to work hand and hand, she voiced concerns about DevOps practices sometimes circumventing controls that are essential to a business&amp;#8217;s safety. She also said that DevOps supports security in a number of ways: from making things consistent to relying on more automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I caught up with&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/justinarbuckle"&gt;Justin Arbuckle&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President, EMEA &amp;amp; Chief Enterprise Architect at Chef.

&lt;h2&gt;Continuous Delivery/Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; First, building a &lt;a href="http://devops.com/2014/07/29/continuous-delivery-pipeline/"&gt;Continuous Delivery/Deployment pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, automating the work of migration and deployment, will force you to clean up inconsistencies and holes in configuration and code deployment, and inconsistencies between development, test and production environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And automated Continuous Delivery and &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039297.do"&gt;Infrastructure as Code&lt;/a&gt; gets rid of dangerous one-of-a-kind &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html"&gt;snowflakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/configuration-drift"&gt;configuration drift&lt;/a&gt; caused by making configuration changes and applying patches manually over time. Which makes systems easier to setup and manage, and reduces the risk of an un-patched system becoming the target of a security attack or the &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7652036"&gt;cause of an operational problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A CD pipeline also makes it easier, cheaper and faster to pay down other kinds of technical debt. With Continuous Delivery/Deployment, you can test and push out patches and refactoring changes and platform upgrades faster and with more confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Positive Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Lean feedback cycle and &lt;a href="http://leankit.com/blog/2015/03/3-reasons-it-ops-uses-lean-flow-kanban-for-devops-part-2-of-3/"&gt;Just-in-Time prioritization&lt;/a&gt; in DevOps ensures that you&amp;#8217;re working on whatever is most important to the business. This means that bugs and usability issues and security vulnerabilities don&amp;#8217;t have to wait until after the next feature release to get fixed. Instead, problems that impact operations or the users will get fixed immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Teams that do &lt;a href="https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/"&gt;Blameless Post-Mortems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2014/11/14/the-infinite-hows-or-the-dangers-of-the-five-whys/"&gt;Root Cause(s) Analysis&lt;/a&gt; when problems come up will go even further, and fix problems at the source and improve in fundamental and important ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But there&amp;#8217;s a negative side to DevOps that can add to technical debt costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Erosive Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Michael Feathers&amp;#8217; research has shown that constant, &lt;a href="http://swreflections.blogspot.ca/2012/10/bad-things-happen-to-good-code.html"&gt;iterative change is erosive&lt;/a&gt;: the same code gets changed over and over, the same classes and methods become bloated (because it is naturally easier to add code to an existing method or a method to an existing class), structure breaks down and the design is eventually lost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; DevOps can make this even worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; DevOps and Continuous Delivery/Deployment involves pushing out lots of small changes, running experiments and iteratively tuning features and the user experience based on continuous feedback from production use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Many DevOps teams work directly on the code mainline, &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://theagileadmin.com/2010/06/24/velocity-2010-always-ship-trunk/"&gt;branching in code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://agiletesting.blogspot.ca/2009/07/dark-launching-and-other-lessons-from.html"&gt;dark launch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; code changes, while code is still being developed, using conditional logic and flags to skip over sections of code at run-time. This can make the code hard to understand, and potentially dangerous: if a &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html"&gt;feature toggle&lt;/a&gt; is turned on before the code is ready,&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110721063430/http://jamesmckay.net/2011/07/why-does-martin-fowler-not-understand-feature-branches/"&gt; bad things can happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Feature flags are also used to run A/B experiments and control risk on release, by rolling out a change incrementally to a few users to start. But the longer that feature flags are left in the code, the &lt;a href="http://swreflections.blogspot.ca/2014/08/feature-toggles-are-one-of-worst-kinds.html"&gt;harder it is to understand and change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; There is a lot of housekeeping that needs to be done in DevOps: upgrading the CD pipeline and making sure that all of the tests are working; maintaining Puppet or Chef (or whatever configuration management tool you are using) recipes; disciplined, &lt;a href="http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2012/04/what-refactoring-is-and-what-it-isnt.html"&gt;day-to-day refactoring&lt;/a&gt;; keeping track of features and options and cleaning them up when they are no longer needed, getting rid of dead code and trying to keep the code as simple as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microservices and Technology Choices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"&gt;Microservices &lt;/a&gt; are a &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/08/microservices-monoliths"&gt;popular architectural approach for DevOps&lt;/a&gt; teams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This is because loosely-coupled Microservices are easier for individual teams to independently deploy, change, &lt;a href="http://jimplush.com/talk/2015/02/28/microservices-allow-for-localized-tech-debt/"&gt;refactor or even replace&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And a Microservices-based approach provides developers with more freedom when deciding on language or technology stack: teams don&amp;#8217;t necessarily have to work the same way, they can choose the right tool for the job, as long as they support an API contract for the rest of the system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the short term there are obvious advantages to giving teams more freedom in making technology choices. They can deliver code faster, quickly try out prototypes, and teams get a chance to experiment and learn about different technologies and languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But Microservices &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a-free-lunch.html"&gt;are not a free lunch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;. As you add more services, system testing costs and complexity increase. Debugging and problem solving gets harder. And as more teams choose different languages and frameworks, it&amp;#8217;s harder to track vulnerabilities, harder to operate, and harder for people to switch between teams. Code gets duplicated because teams want to minimize coupling and it is difficult or impossible to share libraries in a polyglot environment. Data is often duplicated between services for the same reason, and data inconsistencies creep in over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negative Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; There is a potentially negative side to the Lean delivery feedback cycle too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Constantly responding to production feedback, always working on what&amp;#8217;s most immediately important to the organization, doesn&amp;#8217;t leave much space or time to consider bigger, longer-term technical issues, and to work on paying off deeper architectural and technical design debt that result from poor early decisions or incorrect assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Smaller, more immediate problems get fixed fast in DevOps. Bugs that matter to operations and the users can get fixed right away instead of waiting until all the features are done, and patches and upgrades to the run-time can be pushed out more often. Which means that you can pay off a lot of debt before costs start to compound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But behind-the-scenes, strategic debt will continue to add up. Nothing&amp;#8217;s broke, so you don&amp;#8217;t have to fix anything right away. And you can&amp;#8217;t refactor your way out of it either, at least not easily. So you end up living with a poor design or an aging technology platform, slowly slowing down your ability to respond to changes, to come up with new solutions. Or forcing you to continue filling in security holes as they come up, or scrambling to scale as load increases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; DevOps can reduce technical debt. But only if you work in a highly disciplined way. And only if you raise your head up from tactical optimization to deal with bigger, more strategic issues before they become real problems. &lt;/p&gt;

This may not appear obvious when you&amp;#8217;re running Maven from the command line, e.g. via:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;C:\Users\jOOQ\workspace&amp;gt;mvn clean install
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it is rather easy to debug Maven. In order to do so, just create the following batch file on Windows:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;@ECHO OFF

IF "%1" == "off" (
    SET MAVEN_OPTS=
) ELSE (
    SET MAVEN_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compile=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005
)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can do the same also on a MacOS X or Linux box, by using&lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;intead of&amp;#160;&lt;code&gt;SET&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, run the above batch file and proceed again with building:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;C:\Users\jOOQ\workspace&amp;gt;mvn_debug

C:\Users\jOOQ\workspace&amp;gt;mvn clean install
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Maven build will now wait for a debugger client to connect to your JVM on port 5005 (change to any other suitable port). We&amp;#8217;ll do that now with Eclipse. Just add a new Remote Java Application that connects on a socket, and hit &amp;#8220;Debug&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lukaseder.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/port-5005.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lukaseder.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/port-5005.png?w=479" alt="port-5005" class="alignright size-full wp-image-5501"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it. We can now set breakpoints and debug through our Maven process like through any other similar kind of server process. Of course, things work exactly the same way with IntelliJ or NetBeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;re done debugging your Maven process, simply call the batch again with parameter&amp;#160;&lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;C:\Users\jOOQ\workspace&amp;gt;mvn_debug off

C:\Users\jOOQ\workspace&amp;gt;mvn clean install
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And your Maven builds will no longer be debugged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy debugging!&lt;/p&gt;

Out of personal experience, I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that one of the major reasons for that is how tedious it is to have your server&amp;#8217;s load balanced accordingly. Why? Allow me to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad part about capacity management and planning in the past was that it was tedious work collecting all the required host-related metrics. But those days are behind us. Have a look at this sortable table view of monitored-host metrics provided by&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://ruxit.com/availability-and-performance/server-monitoring/" target="_blank"&gt;Ruxit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dzone.com/sites/all/files/images/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-25%20at%209.36.52%20AM.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sorting hosts by metric type can greatly simplify capacity planning&lt;p&gt;Sorting hosts by metric type can greatly simplify capacity planning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having the ability to sort your hosts (both virtual and physical) by metric type helps you to easily see if your infrastructure can handle more load. Having such detailed metrics at your fingertips is a simple first step toward knowing if your hosts are chronically overloaded or under-utilized. If you discover that your hosts are running at less than full capacity you may have the opportunity to save some money by, for example, automatic scaling of VM instances. On the other hand, if your hosts suffer from overload, their performance will be negatively affected. This leads to increased response times and, ultimately, lost revenue. For more on this point, see the Kissmetrics article&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/"&gt;How Loading Time Affects Your Bottom Line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Know the differences between virtual and physical hosts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual hosts can max out their allocated resources while the the physical hosts they reside on sit largely idle with plenty of available capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dzone.com/sites/all/files/images/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-25%20at%209.37.00%20AM.png"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogruxitcom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/virtual-machines-blurred.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember there are physical constraints hehind every virtual host.&lt;p&gt;Remember there are physical constraints hehind every virtual host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other reasons besides maxed out physical-host resources that can cause a VM to sit idle. For example, a physical host may not be able to assign more resources to a VM because one or more other VMs have already claimed all the resources. In such cases, it&amp;#8217;s important to keep a watchful eye on both your physical and your virtual hosts and have integrated metrics and graphs available for comparison. It&amp;#8217;s no fun correlating these numbers manually though. Again, Ruxit can save you hours of manual number crunching here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with all the tedious work behind you you&amp;#8217;re ready for &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The amazing part&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amazing part begins once you&amp;#8217;ve mastered the challenge of identifying your potentially tunable hosts. For me, benchmarking and load testing applications and watching them utilize hardware resources is the really fun part. And with virtualization technology at hand, it&amp;#8217;s easy to find out if your applications scale better horizontally or vertically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to load testing, there are loads of tools available. Google can deliver a list of open source load-testing tools if you&amp;#8217;re interested:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try us out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ruxit.com/"&gt;Give Ruxit a try!&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;Watch your environment under normal load, place some load on your infrastructure, and then see how your resource utilization changes. I&amp;#8217;d love to hear your findings. Does your environment scale better horizontally or vertically? &amp;#160;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to hearing your stories!&lt;/p&gt;

For example, if you want to resolve an address to a latitude/longitude information to display on a map, you might use the &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are building mobile apps then you are connecting to some REST API. For example, if you want to resolve an address to a latitude/longitude information to display on a map, you might use the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/" target="_blank"&gt;Google Geocoding API&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="brush:xml"&gt;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=San Francisco,CA&amp;amp;key=AIzaSyDvFMYGjeR02RH&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Geocoding API:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are invoking the API from the client, then the API key also has to be present on the client. But, this is also the problem. It&amp;#8217;s very easy to look at the app source in the browser and get access to the API key. If someone has access to your API key, they can send requests on your behalf (without you knowing), and use up your request quota. Even if you are building a hybrid app, it&amp;#8217;s still the same problem. A hybrid app is HTML/JavaScript inside a native wrapper, it&amp;#8217;s possible to download the app, un-package it and gain access to API keys or any sensitive information stored in the app.&amp;#160;Even native apps are not immune to&amp;#160;this. For example, an Android app is just a Java application and a Java application can be de-compiled to view the original source. The next image shows how to get access to an API key in the browser:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good solution is to never expose the API key (or any other sensitive data) on the client. How do you do that? You keep the API key and any other sensitive information on the server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-7413 size-large" src="https://katzmax.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-10-at-3-54-57-pm.png?w=780&amp;amp;h=121" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-10 at 3.54.57 PM"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://appery.io/backendservices" target="_blank"&gt;Appery.io Secure Proxy&lt;/a&gt; (part of Backend Services) enables app developers to keep sensitive app data on the server. Your API keys or any other data is never exposed on the client. Watch this 5-minute video on how to use Secure Proxy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="jetpack-video-wrapper" align="center"&gt;&lt;p class="embed-youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before using the Secure Proxy, you need to store the data on the server. To store the data you are going to use the Appery.io Database. It&amp;#8217;s as simple as creating a collection with two columns. The first column is the value name, the second column is the actual value. This is how the database looks when storing the API key for Google Geocoding API:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this key&amp;#160;is stored on the server, no one (but you) has access to it. You can store other data as well such as URLs, tokens or anything else&amp;#160;that shouldn&amp;#8217;t be exposed on the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to setup the proxy that will use the information stored in the database. This step is also very simple, this is how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;You give the proxy a name and then link it to a database which stores your data. The above proxy is linked to &lt;strong&gt;Secrets_db&lt;/strong&gt; database, &lt;strong&gt;Credentials&lt;/strong&gt; collection, and&amp;#160;&lt;strong&gt;secretName&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#160;&lt;strong&gt;secretValue&lt;/strong&gt; columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step is to link a&amp;#160;REST API service to the proxy. &amp;#160;In the service editor you select the secure proxy created:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;then in the Request tab you reference the API key stored in the database (the name stored in secretName column):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;and that&amp;#8217;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the API service is invoked, the call will go through the secure proxy (server) where the API key will substituted:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;For web apps, you can add an extra layer of security by specifying from which page URLs the proxy should accept requests:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proxy will only accept requests from page URLs listed in the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option to keep API keys private is to invoke the API from the server using &lt;a href="http://appery.io/backendservices" target="_blank"&gt;Server Code&lt;/a&gt;, I will cover this in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up an using the Appery.io Secure Proxy is simple. It provides a very important feature by allowing to keep sensitive and private data on the server, never exposing it on the client, and adding an extra security layer to your app.&lt;/p&gt;

learn what works and doesn&amp;#8217;t websites. The reality of getting out of startup mode and
scaling takes vision and the ability to anticipate how you may need to pivot.
There are two main reasons why startups do not scale. The first is a lack of
experience and mentorship. This is
closely followed by a lack of a working capital.&amp;#160; An effective entrepreneur understands not
only how to pivot but how to utilize capital investment. This article aims to demystify the need for investing in site infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scaling a business there are several huge issues that
executives tend to forget. whether you are a startup or a fortune 500 company your website is the organizations public face. Maintaining a clean and secure
site will help to avoid deep routed problems that could potentially destroy not only you site by your reputation.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://www.bluecoat.com/company-blog/2015-05-21/cost-hacking"&gt;Hackers&lt;/a&gt;
can be devastating and end up costing you millions.&amp;#160; Another aspect of your site to consider is funnel optimization. By making this a priority you will be able to
effective guide customers step by step into a conversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American With Disabilities Act (ADA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADA can be a freighting legal area for many
entrepreneurs. Many think that ADA only applies to physical boundaries such as
implementing ramps for wheelchairs and accessible bathroom stalls. However this
is far from the case. Few people know that the digital world also counts. Is your website written in HTML5? If not you
are in violation of ADA.&amp;#160; This newest
version of the HTML coding language allows for an audible version of a web site
for those facing impaired vision.&amp;#160;
However there are some quick an easy ways to gain some ADA points to
allow for more leeway in other more long-term solutions. Implementing &lt;a href="http://www.vicaps.com/closed-captioning-services.php"&gt;closed captioning&lt;/a&gt;
into your promotional videos will allow for increased accessibility for those facing an auditory disability.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investing in infrastructure is not a single step but a
constant to building a good company culture where employees can feel proud of
where they work and remain safe. Please comment on this

From this there has been a fair amount of FUD circulating and not enough rational thought. With that in mind, this seems like a good time to talk about password security and LastPass with some rational ideas. Since we can't get rid of passwords just yet we need to manage them well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. LastPass Detected The Breach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No useful system is impenetrable. Computers not connected to the Internet, that don't even have a network card, have been hacked across an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_&amp;amp;#40;networking&amp;amp;#41;"&gt;air gap&lt;/a&gt; using their speakers and mic. The most up to date systems still suffer from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_&amp;amp;#40;computing&amp;amp;#41;"&gt;zero-day exploits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the elements of an organization that takes security seriously are keeping certain pieces of data separate and detecting when a breach occurs. From the &lt;a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2015/06/lastpass-security-notice.html/"&gt;LastPass announcement of the breach&lt;/a&gt; we can see these two things in action. While some information was obtained the actual vaults of passwords were not downloaded. And, they detected there was a problem and enough monitoring in place to distinguish what was effected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't overstate how nice that is to hear. Many organizations won't detect if they have been breached. Even many of those that could detect a breach wouldn't be able to tell you what was affected. That's right, many of the places you put personal information couldn't do what LastPass did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. LastPass Responded To The Breach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the password vaults were not taken LastPass is having everyone change their vault password. They detected the problem and are going the extra mile to protect their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's consider an alternative option. Consider a &lt;a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://keepass.info"&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt; user who stores their information in Dropbox or a similar service. A malicious program on one of their systems could have taken their vault and sent it to an attacker. Those users would not have known. Or, the service could have been hacked but since it's not password specific who would have suggested changing the master password?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not trying to defend LastPass. It's a matter of considering the alternatives and the security measures around them. Is a 1Password or KeePass alternative setup actually more secure in practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Different Passwords For Different Sites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a good reason to have a different password or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase"&gt;passphrase&lt;/a&gt; for different sites. You can't trust that a site you submit it to will store it securely so that it won't be misused to access other sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the sites we connect to we it's difficult to remember a different password for each site. Congratulations if you can do that. For the rest of us we need a system to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where a password manager is useful. That is, until we can stop using passwords for something better. So, use a password manager if you can't otherwise have a different password for each site. It's more secure than using the same password everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, I'm not recommending a particular password manager on purpose. Use a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Security Is Not About Perfection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as perfect security. Security needs to be practical. For example, for most people it's more security to use a password manager than to use the same password everywhere. Neither is perfect but when you weigh the differences the password manager comes out as more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a distributed device world where we need passwords on more than one system it's good to go with a system that does this for you. A system that focuses on security and handling issues that come up. You could roll your own solution. But, will it be more secure? For most people the professional solution is the more secure one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering password security choose the one that's more secure for you rather than seeking the perfect option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. When Not To Use A Password Manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some places I would recommend not using a password manager. For example, I would recommend not using one for your financial sites. Those few places that are very important use a passphrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Encrypt Your Password Store&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our multi-device world you'll likely need to share your password datastore between devices. And, any device can be hacked even if you don't need to use multiple devices. Imagine a virus on a computer looking for your password excel file and uploading that to someone bad. It happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use an encrypted datastore. This is why password managers are important. They are designed to store your data in an encrypted manner. This way, if someone gets your data store they will have a very hard time reading it. Before they can get to anything they'll need to break the encryption which isn't so easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means, even if an attacker had gotten the password vaults from LastPass, which they didn't, they would not have been able to read the data in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Limit Your Attack Vector&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with LastPass is that they are a known password manager. That makes them a target if someone wants to try and get passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatives that store their distributed information in general purpose systems pose a different attack vector. For example, if you use 1Password or KeePass and store your information in Dropbox you can still be hacked. Dropbox has been externally hacked in the past and other applications can access your Dropbox folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using alternatives to LastPass doesn't mean you won't be attacked. Take a few minutes and consider the attack vectors of the different solutions you're considering and how each of those will detect a breach and respond to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I could self host my encrypted file on the Internet somewhere. This would be managed by me and wouldn't be a known system for someone to target. But, the IPv4 addresses are regularly checked for known vulnerabilities so attackers and get onto a system a poke around. That is the entire IPv4 space, which is still the only space routable for all things, is regular checked. Will I keep everything on that system up to date? Will I detect if someone broke into the system? Will I respond appropriately? All of this needs to be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts On LastPass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not trying to defend LastPass. I'm trying to give a little more of a holistic picture of security. It's complicated and any alternatives to a LastPass or LastPass-like solutions need to have their security considered. Viewing the options with security and attacks in mind keeps everything in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

Outsourcing can be appealing to organizations looking for talent at reasonable costs - it just takes significant planning to pull off successfully. When a team is in a different location from the company, there are a number of challenges that must be overcome. We will look at what some of the biggest issues are and how you can&amp;#160;appropriately manage an&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/products/enterprise-test-management"&gt;quality assurance&lt;/a&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obstacles of outsourcing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 While outsourcing can have a lot of advantages for businesses, the number of roadblocks can be intimidating for many enterprises. Here are the biggest challenges to prepare for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information sharing:&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;When you don't see individuals every day, it can often be easy to forget to relay important messages. Communication in this situation is imperative, as it could affect the overall operation of the application. As soon as a request is given, there should be seamless transfer of knowledge to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the project proceeds as expected. This will eliminate any redundancies and lower the overall development cost.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engagement:&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;Many&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;teams have a difficult time becoming personally involved with their projects. This will also affect their ability to collaborate effectively with other teams in the business, ultimately hurting program quality. Organizations must have a strategy to keep these individuals motivated and provide them with the tools to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology/skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;An&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;team may use different pieces of technology or have skills separate from what the organization was looking for. For example, if the company really wants to move to &lt;a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/products/enterprise-test-management"&gt;agile software development&lt;/a&gt;, but the&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;group still uses waterfall methods, that could create problems down the road for their software development initiatives. Similarly, the business must ensure that the&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;individuals have the skills necessary to meet corporate goals and spur innovation through their app testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to regain control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Although total governance of&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;assets won't be possible, there are still some things that organizations can do to take control of these teams and ensure that they're fulfilling business objectives. Australian outsourcer Beepo suggested a&amp;#160;consistent schedule for gathering feedback&amp;#160;and using technology like the cloud and test management tools. Let's dissect each of these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;teams are often left by the wayside when it comes to communication. This can reasonably lead to mistakes being made and leave the members feeling apathetic toward their work. However, by setting up regular video conferences and requesting feedback,&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;individuals can feel empowered to express their opinions and become a larger part of their projects. This will also help build trust and motivate teams to collaborate more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using tools like &lt;a href="http://www.getzephyr.com"&gt;test management&lt;/a&gt; and the cloud can also be helpful when working with an&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;team due to the fact that they provide a singular platform for all users. This means that the&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;and in-house teams can be working on the same project at the same time, with any changes being made in real time. This will not only reduce redundancies, but it creates accountability and ensures that tasks&amp;#160;are being addressed according to their priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations to make when outsourcing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Whether you're looking to outsource, or simply make your&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;team better, there are some key items to address. Ashok Mani from AppLabs&amp;#160;noted that organizations must look into a provider's&amp;#160;engagement models, mobilization efforts, communication plans, security and scalability. These elements will be essential to clear up before trying to manage a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While organizations are deriving value from outsourcing &lt;a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/white-papers/8.html"&gt;software development&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;software testing will maximize returns from their investments and provide the right level of objectivity and rigor required to create a high-quality product," Mani&amp;#160;stated. "If an independent QA and testing service provider is chosen whose focus is on ensuring quality products/systems are implemented, benefits will be fully maximized."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing a quality assurance&amp;#160;team is going to have a few challenges for businesses. But by preparing for these obstacles, they will be able to manage the&amp;#160;outsourced&amp;#160;group more effectively. Having a communication plan and technology available will be essential to working well with the team and improving development operations.&lt;/p&gt;

This applies if the intended audience for the application is a direct customer of the enterprise (Business-to-Consumer apps, or &amp;#8220;B2C&amp;#8221;), or if the targeted user is an employee or business partner (&amp;#8220;B2E&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;B2B&amp;#8221;, or Business-to-Employee and Business-to-Business apps). Across the globe, more people are now using mobile devices that they can carry with them wherever they go, and which are more user friendly and intuitive to use, as their primary means of obtaining information and requesting services over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Note: maximizing your browser window will share info about your screen size, which might help to identify you&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;check robots.txt to know what to access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example Issues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;no https on login page&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;insecure psw&amp;#160;requirements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;cookies not secure flag =&amp;gt; sent over http incl. AuthCookie)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;psw sent in clear text in confirm email&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;user enumeration, f.eks. an issue with AdultFriendFinder &amp;#8211; entry someone&amp;#8217;s email to login to find out whether they&amp;#8217;ve an account&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;post illegal chars, get them displayed =&amp;gt; injection&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;no anti-automation (captcha) 
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;login confirm. email &amp;amp; autom. creating 1m accounts =&amp;gt; sending 1m emails =&amp;gt; pisses ppl off, likely increase one&amp;#8217;s spam reputation (=&amp;gt; harder to send emails)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;brute-force protection?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### XSS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflected XSS: display unescaped user input&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Encoding context: HTML, JS, CSS &amp;#8230; have diff. escape sequences for the same char (e.g. &amp;lt;) &amp;#8211; look at where they&amp;#8217;re mixed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check the encoding consistency &amp;#8211; manual encoding, omitting some chars&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;JS =&amp;gt; load ext resources, access cookies, manipulate the DOM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Task: stal authCookie via search&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;###&amp;#160;SQL injection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Error-based injection: when the DB helps us by telling us what is wrong -&amp;gt; use ti learn more and even show some data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex.:&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://hackyourselffirst.troyhunt.com/Make/10?orderby=supercarid"&gt;http://hackyourselffirst.troyhunt.com/Make/10?orderby=supercarid&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;lt;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212; supercarid is a column name&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;orderby=(select * from userprofile) &amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;learn about DB sructure, force an exception that shows the valueex.: (select top 1 cast(password) as int from userprofile) =&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;Conversion failed for the nvar value &amp;#8216;passw0rd &amp;#8230;&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;think of SQL commands that disclose structure: sys.(tables,columns), system commands&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;enumerate records: nest queries: select top X ows asc then top 1 rows from that desc&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;write out how you think the query works / is being constructed internally&amp;#160;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;cast things to invalid types to disclose values in err msgs (or implicit cast due to -1 ..)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#### Defenses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;whitelist input data types (id=123 =&amp;gt; onlyallow ints)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;enumerable values &amp;#8211; check against an appropr. whitelist&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;if the value is stored &amp;#8211; who uses it, how? making query/insertion safe&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;permissions: give read-only permissions as much as possible; don&amp;#8217;t use admin user from your webapp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;###&amp;#160;Mobile apps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Look at HTTP req for sensitive data &amp;#8211; creds, account, &amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apps may ignore certificate validations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In your app: param tampering, auth bypass, direct object refs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Weak &amp;#160;often: airlines, small scale shops, fast foods, &amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;certificate pining &amp;#8211; the app has the fingerprint of the server cert. hardcoded and doesn&amp;#8217;t trust even &amp;#8220;valid&amp;#8221; MITM certificate (banks, dropbox, &amp;#8230;)x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;###&amp;#160;CSRF Cross-Site Request Forgery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;= make the user send a request =&amp;gt; their auth cookie included&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;async Ajax req to another site forbidden but that doesn&amp;#8217;t apply to normal post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;anti-forgery tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### Understanding fwrk disclosure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shodanhq.com/"&gt;http://www.shodanhq.com/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;-&amp;gt; search for&amp;#160;&amp;#8220;drupal 7&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; pwn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How disclosed:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;headers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;#160;familiar signs &amp;#8211; jsessionid cookie for java, &amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The default error and 404 responses may help to recognize the fwr&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;HTML code (reactid), &amp;#8220;.do&amp;#8221; for Sttruts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;implicit: order of headers (Apache x IIS), paths (capitalized?), response to improper HTTP version/protocol,&amp;#160; 
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;=&amp;gt; likely still possible to figure out the stack but not possible to simple search for fwrk+version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### Session hijacking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steal authentication cookie =&amp;gt; use for illegal requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Persistence over HTTP of auth., session: cookie, URL (but URL insecure &amp;#8211; can be shared)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Session/auth ID retrieval: insecure transport, referrer, stored in exceptions, XSS&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Factors limiting hijacking: short duration expiry, keyed to client device / IP (but IPs may rotate, esp, on mobile devices =&amp;gt; be very cautious)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAY 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8211;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### Cracking passwords&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Password hashing:&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;salt: so that 2 ppl choosing the same psw will have a different hash =&amp;gt; cracking is # salts * # passwords inst. of just N&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;has cracking tips: 
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;character space &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dictionary: passw0rd, &amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mutations: manipulation and subst. of characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1Password , LastPass, &amp;#8230;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GPU ~ 100* faster than CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#### Ex: Crack with hashcat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;common psw dict + md5-hashed passwords =&amp;gt; crack&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;./hashcat-cli64.bin &amp;#8211;hash-type=0&amp;#160;StratforHashes.txt&amp;#160;hashkiller.com.dic # 23M psw dict -&amp;gt;&amp;#160;Recovered.: 44 326/860 160 hashes [obs duplications] in 4 min (speed 135.35k plains)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: What dictionary we use? Do we apply any mutations to it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### Account enumeration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;= Does XY have an account?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Multiple vectors (psw reset, register a new user with the same e-mail, &amp;#8230;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anti-automation: is there any? It may be inconsistent across vectors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does it matter?&amp;#160;(&amp;lt;&amp;gt; privacy needs)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to &amp;#8220;ask&amp;#8221; the site and how to identify + and &amp;#8211; responses?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Timing attacks: distinguish positive x negative response based on the latency differing between the two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### HTTPS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidentiality, Integrity, Authenticity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic hijacking:&amp;#160;[a href="https://www.wifipineapple.com/"]https://www.wifipineapple.com/&amp;#160;&amp;#8211; wifi hotspot with evil capabilities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;monitor probe requests (the phone looks for networks it knows), present yourself as one of those, the phone connects autom. (if no encryption)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consider everything sent over HTTP to be compromised&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Look at HTTPS content embedded in untrusted pages (iframes, links) &amp;#8211; e.g. payment page embedded in http&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;HSTS Preload &amp;#8211; tell Chrome, FF that your site should only be ever loaded over HTTPS &amp;#8211;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://hstspreload.appspot.com/"&gt;https://hstspreload.appspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security"&gt;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### Content Scurity Policy header&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy"&gt;https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;See e.g.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;headers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;w/o CSP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;anything can be added to the page via a reflected XSS risk&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anyth, can be added to the DOM downstream (on a proxy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With CSP the browser will only load resources you white-list; any violations can be reported&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use e.g.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://report-uri.io/home/generate"&gt;https://report-uri.io/home/generate&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;to create it and the report to watch for violations to fine tune it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### SQL injection cont&amp;#8217;d&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yesterday: Error-Based)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#### Union Based SQLi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify the query to union whatever other data and show them. More data faster than error-based inj.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex.:&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://hackyourselffirst.troyhunt.com/CarsByCylinders?Cylinders=V12"&gt;http://hackyourselffirst.troyhunt.com/CarsByCylinders?Cylinders=V12&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;: &amp;#160;V12 -&amp;gt; `V12&amp;#8242; union select voteid, comments collate SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS from vote&amp;#8211; `&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#### Blind Boolean (laborious)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blind inj.: We can&amp;#8217;t always rely on data being explicitly returned to the UI =&amp;gt; ask a question, draw a conclusion about the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex:&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hackyourselffirst.troyhunt.com/Supercar/Leaderboard?orderBy=PowerKw&amp;amp;asc=false"&gt;http://hackyourselffirst.troyhunt.com/Supercar/Leaderboard?orderBy=PowerKw&amp;amp;asc=false&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;-&amp;gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ordedby =&amp;gt; case when (select count(*) from userprofile) &amp;gt; 1 then powerkw else topspeedkm end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extract email: Is ascii of the lowercase char #1 &amp;lt; ascii of m ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation: SqlMap&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#### Time based blind injection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When no useful output returned but yes/no responses differ significantly in how much time they take. F.ex. ask the db to delay the OK response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS SQL: IF &amp;#8216;b&amp;#8217; &amp;gt; &amp;#8216;a&amp;#8217; WAITFOR DELAY &amp;#8217;00:00:05&amp;#8242;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### Brute force attacks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are there any defences? Often not&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How are defences impl? 
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;block the req resources&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;block the src IP&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;rate limit (by src IP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### Automation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;penetration testing apps and services such as Netsparker,&amp;#160;WhiteHatSec&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;targets identification: shodan, googledorks, randowm crawling&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;think aout the actions that adhere to a pattern &amp;#8211; sql injection, fuzzing (repeat a req. trying diff. values for fields &amp;#8211; SQLi, &amp;#8230;), directory enumeration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;automation can be used for good &amp;#8211; test your site&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;tip: have autom. penetration testing (and perhaps static code analysis) as a part fo your build pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Task: Get DB schema using sqlmap (see python2.7 sqlmap.py &amp;#8211;help)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;### Protection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrusion Detection System (IDS) &amp;#8211; e.g. Snort&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Application Firewall (WAF) &amp;#8211; e.g. CloudFare ($20/m)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While DockerCon was shaking things up with the &lt;a href="http://devops.com/2015/06/23/ocp-is-a-victory-for-coreos-and-containers-in-general/"&gt;announcement of the Open Container Project&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit/"&gt;Red Hat Summit&lt;/a&gt; in Boston held its own share of big news and much of it spotlighted the important role of open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Red Hat is really the independent voice of Linux focused entirely on business,&amp;#8221; said Rob Enderle, principal analyst with the &lt;a href="http://enderlegroup.com/"&gt;Enderle Group&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;It is also a showcase of how to make money on the platform without taking advantage of anyone in the process and largely remaining true to the core tenets that created Linux in the first place.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on Open Source&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary core tenets&amp;#8212;if not the defining core tenet&amp;#8212;of Linux is open source. The shared development and collaborative nature of the operating system as an open source project is its main strength. At the Red Hat Summit open source played an even larger role than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The company continues to show strong momentum for OpenShift Commons as the re-write of the technology is moving forward showing that the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) battles are alive and well,&amp;#8221; explained Al Hilwa, program director of software development research for &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;Red Hat also rebranded and updated its FeedHenry platform as it continues to turn it fully into open source and integrate it with OpenShift.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Samsung Partnership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the focus on open source, the other big news out of the Red Hat Summit was a new strategic alliance with Samsung. Samsung will push Red Hat&amp;#8217;s mobile platform and potentially other software into the enterprise in a more integrated fashion as a function of the new partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship has potential, but according to Enderle there are both positive and negative outcomes possible. &amp;#8220;Samsung needs Red Hat far more than Red Hat needs Samsung because Red Hat provided the enterprise brand that Samsung needs to penetrate the space. Samsung is a firm that has never found a platform they didn&amp;#8217;t like and have historically been unable to focus on any one of them for extended periods of time,&amp;#8221; cautions Enderle. &amp;#8220;Red Hat alone won&amp;#8217;t be able to fix that and Samsung&amp;#8217;s behavior could actually tarnish Red Hat if they aren&amp;#8217;t careful.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strong Momentum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilwa also made another observation about the strength of Red Hat&amp;#8217;s business model. &amp;#8220;That the company will cruise through the two billion dollar annual revenue barrier sometime this year is all but certain with its posted rates of growth. This is an enormous milestone for the open source world.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll have to wait and see how the Red Hat / Samsung partnership pans out for either company, but the Red Hat Summit highlighted the strength of Red Hat&amp;#8217;s momentum and the unstoppable juggernaut of open source development.&lt;/p&gt;

But many enterprises have run into problems scaling containers across their infrastructure to account for issues like networking and load balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rancher Labs, a Cupertino-based cloud software startup, is hoping to help organizations address the scalability with a new open-source Docker platform. Eponymously dubbed Rancher, the beta version for the platform went live this week. It&amp;#8217;s designed to be a full set of tools to help DevOps teams manage Docker containers in production. The platform folds in infrastructure services built specifically for containers, including networking, storage management, load balancing, service discovery, monitoring, and resource management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of containers is efficiency and full portability, but Sheng Liang, co-founder and CEO at Rancher Labs, notes that the implementation can be hard to get perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As users deploy containers across different infrastructures, they quickly realize that different clouds, virtualization platforms and bare metal servers have dramatically different infrastructure capabilities,&amp;#8221; said Liang. It&amp;#8217;s these variables that Rancher seeks to limit. &amp;#8220;By building a common infrastructure backplane across any resource, Rancher implements an entirely new approach to hybrid cloud computing,&amp;#8221; said Liang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is going long on containers&amp;#8212;an assessment that backers agree with. The company also recently announced that it has received $10 million in series A funding from Mayfield and Nexus Venture Partners. In addition to its Rancher suite, the company also produces RancherOS, a minimalist Linux distribution tightly focused on running Docker containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management team behind Rancher is one that is familiar to many cloud practitioners. Co-founder and CEO Sheng Liang was co-founder and CEO of Cloud.com, and continued on at Citrix as CTO of Cloud Platforms Group after the company&amp;#8217;s 2011 acquisition.&amp;#160; Also on board are Cloud.com and Citrix veterans Shannon Williams as vice president of sales and marketing, Darren Shepherd as chief architect and Will Chan as vice president of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to industry analyst Paul Burns, Rancher Labs&amp;#8217; niche is ripe for new innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In its current state, running any containerization solution at scale and in production requires a significant amount of effort from those adopting the solution,&amp;#8221; says Burns, who is president of analyst firm Neovise. &amp;#8220;Key functions such as networking, service discovery, storage and load balancing can cause integration issues, keeping enterprises from truly reaping the benefits desired. By providing a unique solution that eases and simplifies the management of container software, Rancher is allowing companies to better utilize and benefit from the technology.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

On June 2, Val Scott along with Rick Slade of IBM joined Alan Shimel of DevOps.com in a &lt;a href="http://devops.com/2015/05/12/webinar-show-me-success-before-ill-invest-in-devops-a-hm-health-solutions-case-study/" target="_blank"&gt;webcast&lt;/a&gt; to discuss this interesting client case study.&amp;#160; During their discussion, they illustrated in vivid detail how HM Health Solutions showed success in DevOps to their senior executives, for them to buy in and sponsor the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Val and Rick&amp;#8217;s webinar parallels many similar discussions I&amp;#8217;ve had with senior executives.&amp;#160; To net it out, the bottom line is, as it was so clearly and unequivocally articulated in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OaiSHcHM0PA?t=11" target="_blank"&gt;this amusing clip from the movie Jerry Maguire: &amp;#8220;Show Me The Money!&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OaiSHcHM0PA?t=11" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-8042 size-medium" src="http://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cuba-gooding-jr-show-me-the-money-jerry-maguire-219x300.jpg" alt="cuba gooding jr show me the money jerry maguire" width="219" height="300"&gt; &lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-8043 " src="http://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tom-cruise-show-me-the-money-jerry-maguire-300x162.jpg" alt="tom cruise show me the money jerry maguire" width="359" height="194"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When I meet with senior LOB, Finance or IT executives &amp;#8212; they shout a similar refrain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;All I want to do is buy a business outcome.&amp;#160; I want to invest in an IT project, and have it pay back.&amp;#160; Unfortunately for many application development (or other types of enterprise IT) projects, that pay back is illusory, and ROI difficult to measure.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212; Jane or John Executive, representing nearly every IT executive or CFO I have ever met&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many struggle to quantify, monetize and demonstrate the financial return on investing in IT projects.&amp;#160; Yet &lt;a href="http://ibm.biz/devops-ard-mgr1" target="_blank"&gt;as described in this blog&lt;/a&gt;, it is the primary responsibility and outcome of management; leading the economic performance of their department or unit.&amp;#160; Show me the money!&amp;#160; Fortunately, many clients experience positive returns, both operationally and economically.&amp;#160; &lt;a href="http://ibm.biz/devops-ard-mgr3" target="_blank"&gt;Ten (with links to more) client case studies with returns are highlighted in this blog,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/docs/customer-references/" target="_blank"&gt;summarized on this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you undoubtedly have experienced yourself, senior executives respond to clear business value and benefits articulated as financial returns, as ROI.&amp;#160; But how do you do that for DevOps, a set of technical practices and associated culture change?&amp;#160; As &lt;a href="http://devops.com/2015/05/12/webinar-show-me-success-before-ill-invest-in-devops-a-hm-health-solutions-case-study/" target="_blank"&gt;Val and Rick described during their informative webcast&lt;/a&gt;, comparing productivity, time-to-market, speed of delivery, and quality, both before and after a DevOps pilot, are crucial.&amp;#160; These operational metrics will be improved by adopting DevOps.&amp;#160; However, to win the hearts and minds of senior executives, you have to monetize the results, in other words &amp;#8211; show them the money!&amp;#160; Technical techniques and practices such as those Val and Rick described to Alan, shifting left, test driven development, and automating application build, deployment, and test are absolutely necessary, but they are insufficient to win the argument with senior executives.&amp;#160; The gains they produce are necessary, and impressive.&amp;#160; The operational results have been stellar thus far at HM Health Solutions, per Val:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a 67% reduction in resource demands on the release team &amp;amp; process,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a 75% reduction in relative hours to repair defects per environment,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an 82% reduction in application deployment time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet as impressive as these operational results are, they are insufficient.&amp;#160; As Val described, arguments about business value, technical value, or improvements to developer or operations staff productivity, alone did not persuade the management.&amp;#160; The magic word is an economic and financial one: &amp;#8220;investment&amp;#8221;.&amp;#160; Making a strategic investment to improve delivery speed and quality of business applications was the key to winning the hearts and minds of the senior executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the technical practices described above, Alan asked Val to describe the tools HM Health Solutions adopted.&amp;#160; A continuous delivery solution with &lt;a href="https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/" target="_blank"&gt;application release automation software from IBM UrbanCode&lt;/a&gt; was implemented, including application build, deploy, and release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way of summarizing the webcast for the audience, Alan asked Rick and Val for their two key takeaways; the two most important messages and things to remember.&amp;#160; Rick&amp;#8217;s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing which metrics are critical to your organization.&amp;#160; There are many benefits to adopting DevOps, and many potential hard numbers that are straightforward to capture and measure.&amp;#160; Deciding which metrics have the most impact and are most persuasive to your stakeholders is critical to making the case to invest in DevOps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing tools and automation: automated testing, and linking that to build and deployment processes and automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Val&amp;#8217;s:&amp;#160; Rick&amp;#8217;s two takeaways of course!&amp;#160;&amp;#160; And one more&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DevOps is new in the industry, and is not yet well understood or common practice in enterprise IT or among its leaders.&amp;#160; Understand your audience, and become good at explaining it in straightforward and clear business and financial terms to senior executives.&amp;#160; Especially persuasive are other client proof points, and the results of pilots in your own enterprise IT environment.&amp;#160; Make sure pilot results show that the solution works and delivers timely business value, and that the related facts and metrics clearly quantify the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/docs/customer-references/" target="_blank"&gt;Read this blog to know more&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ibm.biz/devops-ard-mgr3" target="_blank"&gt;Check out other customer proof points/ case studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very informative, fast paced, and information rich webcast.&amp;#160; &lt;a href="http://devops.com/2015/05/12/webinar-show-me-success-before-ill-invest-in-devops-a-hm-health-solutions-case-study/" target="_blank"&gt;I hope that you find the replay&lt;/a&gt; useful in continuing your DevOps adoption journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/" target="_blank"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://newrelic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt; have done an amazing job of spotting the trends early and building their tools and services around a new wave of development processes. Chef and Docker alone have reportedly raised nearly $250 million, and New Relic went public in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this very website is another example of how impactful these new development practices are &amp;#8212; as several specialized news outlets have been born out of these revolutionary development strategies. So, not only has the DevOps methodology helped developers create better products, faster; but the process has opened opportunities for technical experts to share their experiences on sites like this, e-books, webinars, conferences and any other way people communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On DevOps.com, you&amp;#8217;ll see the best articles on the web discussing how DevOps is defined in different organizations, why Fortune-500 companies are shifting old practices toward CD and the best practices of CI from industry experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the race to be the most DevOps-friendly solution &amp;#8212; no matter the niche &amp;#8212; hundreds of startups have been founded and funded, which has only enhanced the toolboxes of thousands of developers. You&amp;#8217;d be hard-pressed to find a good SaaS company that doesn&amp;#8217;t offer integration with Jenkins CI, TeamCity or Chef, and that&amp;#8217;s because not only should a SaaS product solve an important problem, but it should have minimum disruption of your current development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, &lt;a href="http://devops.com/2015/05/27/continuous-testing-what-exactly-is-it/" target="_blank"&gt;Continuous Testing&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most exciting spaces in technology today. Continuous Testing is a process that aims to synchronize testing and QA with dev and ops, which ultimately yields better products more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several factors that make Continuous Testing successful in a team&amp;#8217;s software development lifecycle &amp;#8212; such as open-source collaboration solutions, test automation APIs and tools to track the historic performance of applications .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of &lt;a href="https://loadimpact.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Load Impact Version 3.0&lt;/a&gt;, the global performance and load testing SaaS company has announced its latest feature that fits right in with the DevOps mindset: &lt;a href="http://www.virtual-strategy.com/2015/06/15/load-impact-releases-version-30-performance-testing-platform#axzz3d8QAlG2Q" target="_blank"&gt;Performance trending&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance trending allows users to plot runs of the same test over time. That gives companies a clear view into data that locates patterns of performance degradation or improvement in order to easily validate code and infrastructure changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of Continuous Testing, DevOps, CD and CI &amp;#8212; performance trending improves users&amp;#8217; ability to gain both a low-level and high-level view into the performance of their systems. And with the increased number of tests run by DevOps professionals, performance trending yields valuable information for companies concerned with their application performance &amp;#8212; which should be everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between DevOps.com and plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/" target="_blank"&gt;great conferences&lt;/a&gt; and meetups around the world, it&amp;#8217;s safe to say this economy of DevOps-minded tools will only continue to grow in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

The explosion of public cloud technologies has caused an identical revolt amongst development teams who no longer want to&amp;#8212;or need to&amp;#8212;wait for IT to spin up the IT infrastructure needed to fuel their development efforts. The reality is public cloud has drastically changed the expectations of developers &amp;#8211; even if they aren&amp;#8217;t using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days where development teams are satisfied with putting in a help desk request for a new server and waiting to access it. Developers now expect IT to provide services similar to what they can get from a public cloud provider. And if you can&amp;#8217;t provide it? Then you risk them pulling out a credit card and bypassing everything you&amp;#8217;ve built. But just as shadow IT can wreak havoc on data security and IT budgets, there&amp;#8217;s a whole new set of problems that can arise when shadow IT hits the infrastructure level. So now that the developers&amp;#8217; expectations for immediate resources have been changed irrevocably by public cloud, what can IT do to bridge the gap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calling a truce: provide self-service provisioning and management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the obvious one&amp;#8212;give developers the immediate access to IT resources that they need to do their jobs. IT needs to leverage its existing investment in virtualization technologies by providing self-service provisioning and virtual machine management capabilities to developers. In other words, get out of the way and give them what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the minimum, IT should be looking to setup an internal cloud management system which provides IT an on-premises solution with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#160; &amp;#160; Integration to existing authentication/authorization systems (e.g. Active Directory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#160; &amp;#160; Quotas to control usage by employee/group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#160; &amp;#160; Chargeback/showback to provide usage tracking and accounting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving back control is the best way to ease what can be a tenuous relationship between IT and developers. Developers will be happier because they will be provisioning new servers in minutes rather than days and IT can focus on more interesting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract away the complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-service provisioning is only step one. IT needs to get out of the business of provisioning servers and let developers manage their virtual machines themselves. However, that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that IT should leave developers to manage every aspect of their cloud usage on their own. On the contrary, IT&amp;#8217;s job should be to create the tools and infrastructure to ensure best practices within your organization and track IT infrastructure resources to avoid unnecessary infrastructure costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how? The first step is using a centralized automation and orchestration technology. I won&amp;#8217;t get into the religious battle between the various flavors&amp;#8212;Puppet, Chef and Ansible are the three most common that we see and they all have their strengths and weaknesses. However, they all provide the type of framework IT needs to empower self-service provisioning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT should own the base OS images which developers can use for their virtual machines and use an automation framework to provide the means so that developers can easily set up a common set of framework applications (e.g. web servers, databases, monitoring tools, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT can also use cloud management tools to effectively track resources. We&amp;#8217;ve seen many instances where customers have discovered numerous unused VMs. By tracking resources and enforcing expiration dates on certain resources, IT can deliver infrastructure more cost effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give users choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly not all clouds are created equal. And certainly not for all tasks. An internal VMWare virtualization may provide a great cloud&amp;#8212;once IT has provided the services mentioned above&amp;#8212;for most developer&amp;#8217;s needs&amp;#8212;but don&amp;#8217;t stop there. For example, public clouds, like AWS, Azure, Google, have servers located all around the world. &amp;#160;That makes them ideal for web applications which are going to have geographically dispersed users. Most IT shops certainly shouldn&amp;#8217;t be trying to duplicate that capability or prevent its usage. Embrace it instead, where appropriate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that IT shouldn&amp;#8217;t have visibility and control into that usage. IT should strive to create a system which supports a collection of private and public clouds, has unified chargeback/showback and quotas across ALL of the private and public clouds that IT wants to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract Away the Complexity to Support Teams Beyond Developers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These best practices shouldn&amp;#8217;t be limited to developers! One of my favorite use cases that I have seen was an IT shop which provided their sales team with the capability to spin up VMs for product demos. They encapsulated the complexity of 10+ product variations and multiple operating system varieties into a single dialog box. &amp;#160;When the sales manager wanted to do a demo, they checked a couple of boxes in a dialog box, hit submit and a VM was spun up on their internal VMWare cloud which automatically expired 8 hours later. This was a perfect example of allowing a non-technical user to control of their own virtual machines while IT maintained complete control of the underlying technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain flexibility!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final word of caution: the world of private and hybrid cloud is changing very rapidly. IT needs to be able to utilize their existing virtualization infrastructure, typically VMware, today while exploring new private cloud options like OpenStack and preparing for the future of containerization and micro-services. &amp;#160;It&amp;#8217;s important to avoid solutions which are locked into a particular technology&amp;#8212;which may leave IT behind in this rapidly changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that public cloud has led developers to have drastically increased expectations for private IT. By putting in place a cloud management platform backed by DevOps server automation, IT can meet these expectations and stop the growth of shadow IT at the infrastructure level.&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to automate routine tasks and have triggers that automatically initiate other tasks takes care of all of the routine functions so developers and IT personnel can focus on bigger issues. One thing that has also emerged as driving force for DevOps&amp;#8212;and IT in general&amp;#8212;is APIs. Organizations have different platforms and tools from different vendors and they need everything to integrate smoothly together. The APIs enable that synchronicity but add another layer of complexity to develop and manage the APIs as well. That&amp;#8217;s where &lt;a href="https://www.akana.com/"&gt;Akana&lt;/a&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akana enables organizatiions to quickly deliver scalable applications, connect and integrate applications, and share data as APIs. The Akana API Management Platform was created to give developers and IT personnel the tools necessary to effectively develop and manage APIs. Akana recently introduced &lt;a href="http://devops.com/2015/04/22/the-continuous-continuousness-of-devops/"&gt;new capabilities in its API Management Platform&lt;/a&gt; to streamline API management and reduce the time required to update APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem organizations face is that DevOps disrupts the traditional workflow and creates new bottlenecks. DevOps is sort of a natural evolution of Agile development&amp;#8212;taking the principles of Agile beyond developers to the IT infrastructure and the company as a whole so that everyone can keep up with the faster pace of development. The rapid deployment of apps, however, can have a cascade effect that impacts the API lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As new apps are deployed the API definitions can change. Those changes have to be propagated to the API portal. The API owner has to update associated documentation. In most cases this process is a tedious manual exercise. The new Akana API Management Platform seeks to change that by bringing DevOps-style automation to the API lifecycle management process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new API Management Platform integrates with &lt;a href="http://devops.com/2015/04/22/the-continuous-continuousness-of-devops/"&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; platforms like &lt;a href="http://devops.com/2015/05/06/step-step-dataart-processes-application-backlogs-converting-legacy-apps-devops-approaches/"&gt;Jenkins and TeamCity&lt;/a&gt;. It has provisions for tracking necessary approvals to push updates to the API portal or API gateway. It also includes support for standard API descriptor document types like Swagger, RAML and WADL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;APIs have fast become the de-facto standard for digital enterprises to connect applications and services with digital end-points like mobile apps and internet-of-things,&amp;#8221; said Brent Carlson, Senior Vice President, Technology, at Akana. &amp;#8220;With this new capability, enterprises can deliver continuous innovation with speed and agility, ensuring that new updates and capabilities are automatically, efficiently and securely delivered to their developers and partners, in a timely fashion and without manual intervention.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how streamlined you get you&amp;#8217;ll eventually hit a bottleneck. As more of the development and deployment process gets automated that bottleneck gets moved farther down the chain, but then new platforms and tools emerge to address evolving issues and fix the new bottlenecks. For some organizations that have already embraced DevOps APIs may be the new bottleneck, but a tool like the Akana API Management Platform may alleviate that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see where the next bottleneck strikes. At some point as DevOps evolves and every element is streamlined and automated the only bottlenecks will be organic&amp;#8212;meaning the human beings involved in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

As more businesses rely on virtualisation, containers, cloud, Infrastructure as a Service and Microservices is there still a role for IT Operations? How do these teams change to continue to deliver value when supporting Agile Operations techniques?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there still a role for IT Operations? Absolutely 100% (we believe that so much we &lt;a href="http://www.devopsguys.com/"&gt;started a company&lt;/a&gt; to offer application-centric cloud operations!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We blogged about this back in 2013 when we said that &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://blog.devopsguys.com/2013/02/17/devops-does-not-equal-developers-managing-production/"&gt;Devops Does Not Equal &amp;#8220;Developers Managing Production&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;. We said then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Operations is a discipline, with its own patterns &amp;amp; practices, methodologies, models, tools, technology etc. Just because modern cloud hosting makes it easier to deploy servers without having to know one end of a SCSI cable from another doesn&amp;#8217;t mean you &amp;#8220;know&amp;#8221; how to do Operations (just like my knowledge of SQL is enough to find out the information I need to know monitor and manage the environment but a long way from what&amp;#8217;s required to develop a complex, high-performing website).&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; @TheOpsMgr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This&amp;#160;still holds true today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the role of Operations is changing &amp;#8211; Ops has to become more &amp;#8220;Application-Centric&amp;#8221; and understand the applications that are running on the platforms they provide. It&amp;#8217;s not enough anymore to take a narrow view that says &amp;#8220;my servers are OK, it&amp;#8217;s not my fault the application doesn&amp;#8217;t work&amp;#8221;. Well, it might not be your &amp;#8220;fault&amp;#8221; but you share the responsibility for making sure the application is available for your customers. Stop passing the buck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operations people almost certainly need to learn to code, since we are heading towards a code-driven, API enabled world.&amp;#160; If you can&amp;#8217;t code (or at least have solid scripting skills) you risk being left behind will be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the Operations Engineer/Developer of the future will be filling a role more akin to that of a &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_engineering"&gt;process engineer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; in a physical factory or logistical supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A process engineer designs a process and production line that transforms raw materials into a finished product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Operations Engineer/Developer of the future will be building Digital Supply Chains and Digital Production Lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Digital Supply Chains will transform raw materials (source code) via continuous integration, test automation, packaging, release automation, infrastructure-as-code etc into applications running in cloud-hosted environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate of changes flowing along the Digital Supply Chain will far exceed &amp;#8220;old school&amp;#8221; Change and Release methodologies &amp;#8211; you can&amp;#8217;t have a weekly CAB (Change Advisory Board) meeting if you&amp;#8217;re doing multiple deployments per day (or every 11.6 seconds&amp;#160;&amp;#224;&amp;#160;la Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, just like a physical production line includes statistical sampling, automated testing etc., so will the Digital Supply Chain of the future. We already do this with TDD/BDD, automated testing with tools like Selenium etc but it will become the Operations Engineer/Developer job to ensure that the digital production line delivers release packages of sufficient quality to ensure the stability of the application (and the organisation&amp;#8217;s revenue that depends on it!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern supply chains are complex and have many interdependencies on 3rd parties, particularly if you&amp;#8217;re operating a &amp;#8220;Just-In-Time&amp;#8221; (JIT) model. Modern software applications have the ultimate in JIT dependencies due to their integrations with 3rd party SaaS API&amp;#8217;s like payment gateways, recommendation engines, authentication gateways, cloud providers etc. Modern Operations Engineers will need to ensure that they design the digital supply chain that can cope with failures in these interdependencies, or at least ensure that they select the right 3rd party partners who can offer the right levels of performance and availability needed for their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, will the Operations Engineer/Developer of the future be &amp;#8220;just managing (virtual) servers&amp;#8221;? No, almost certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they will be doing is designing and building complex digital supply chains with complex interdependencies both internally and externally to the organisation, digital supply chains designed to meet the needs of applications that are designed to meet the needs of their customers, safely, securely and cost-effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A above is&amp;#160;part of material prepared as our contribution to an CA ebook on &amp;#8220;Agile Operations&amp;#8221;. We wrote our thoughts on 6&amp;#160;questions, of which 4 will be used in the ebook, scheduled to come out in August 2015. You can read the earlier Q&amp;amp;A here &amp;#8211;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://blog.devopsguys.com/2015/06/23/what-is-important-for-an-it-ops-to-team-more-effectively-with-preproduction-teams-devops/" target="_blank"&gt;http://blog.devopsguys.com/2015/06/23/what-is-important-for-an-it-ops-to-team-more-effectively-with-preproduction-teams-devops/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;

In many managers' points of view the product is often not developed fast enough, presented estimates too big and developers are focusing too much on robustness of solutions for which customers just would not pay. On the other side, developers frequently perceive managers as people pushing forward without looking at the current situation, ignoring some technical consequences of their decisions and forcing programmers to create rubbish and cheap solutions. The fact is that there is always not enough time to create a product in the technical way with which we would like to. Many developers are hopping from job to job in a search of a holy grail project. To meet both sides expectations, some standard can be set and developer productivity measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, here even bigger obstacles emerge. How the heck do you measure developer productivity? I will not even mention lines of code metrics as it simply tells you almost nothing. The number of bugs or issues solved is also not the best one. It is very hard to assure that each task is equal in terms of required amount of time to finish. Most of the currently used metrics are only half measures. Very often the biggest impact have a more or less biased leader or senior developers opinion about a specific programmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is very hard to measure productivity, we can more easily identify what things have a negative impact on it and try to remove them. By the way, it would be great to have good measuring methods to check how removing each of the problems listed below would affect performance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of fast and good unit tests - under such circumstances introducing any change is rather troublesome. The developer does not know what exact behaviour the code should provide and if their change has broken anything. Diligent developers might spend enormous amount of time verifying correctness of their commits. Not being diligent enough might introduce major bugs. Professional ones would spend quite a lot of time allocated to issue for unit tests creation (which is IMHO the right way),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Project compilation and local deployment takes quite a lot of time - while what amount of time is too long might be disputable, several minutes is quite a lot for sure. Imagine that after each change a developer has to wait 10 minutes to check application behaviour. It is quite distracting and demotivating and can significantly lower the performance. To countermeasure it you can not only spend some time on tuning the build but also use one of the frameworks for reloading code changes instantly &amp;#160;(like for example&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/"&gt;JRebel&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developers' Continuous Integration feedback loop takes a lot of time - after the commit is pushed to repository, your CI server should present results as fast as possible. If a developer needs to wait for more than 1 hour for their commit results they can simply forget about it or check it another day. Under such circumstances it is difficult to create a feeling of common responsibility for the project. It might happen that one dedicated person would need to be a CI watch and will have to monitor builds, spend time on failure analysis, notify responsible programmers and ensure that they have fixed what was broken,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Badly structured code (code name: spaghetti code) - the bigger the amount of spaghetti the more amount of time is required to introduce a change. It is harder to track dependencies. A lot of code needs to be checked and deeply investigated to fully understand what is going on and avoid regression. Each change might have an impact on many modules that look like they are not related. The chances to introduce bugs are big,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Requirements are not clear - quite a common case in software development. In such a situation developers often spend more time on research what in fact needs to be implemented than on the implementation itself. Additionally, as a result it frequently happens that implementation is not exactly what the customer wanted and additional work is required to handle the requirement. What&amp;#8217;s worth mentioning is that depending on staff characteristics, it might be a really demotivating factor,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of motivation - the last but not least. It is one of the biggest performance and productivity problems. While of course some people are more or less motivated by their nature, an employee has the biggest impact on this factor. It is strictly the responsibility of leaders, managers and organizational culture if developers will be motivated or not. Usually it is mainly about the atmosphere and relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the above issues are not easy to address. Some require aside projects that do not bring immediate value (no customer paying for them), some need major organizational changes. What I find the most difficult here is to create business cases for them. How to exactly measure developer productivity and how to estimate how each change would affect it. The lack of clear indicators is usually a blocker for many organizations to start changes or projects solving the above problems. Very strong conviction and developer feelings are often not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

Any interruption to our service impacts our customers a lot, so we need to make sure we&amp;#8217;re resolving any service interruption immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By building our system to be very resilient with &lt;a href="http://blog.codeship.com/immutable-infrastructure/"&gt;immutable infrastructure at the core,&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;#8217;re able to react to most interruptions quickly. Additionally &lt;a href="http://blog.codeship.com/fast-software-development-workflow/"&gt;we&amp;#8217;ve implemented automatic health checks&lt;/a&gt; to remove systems from production as soon as the load or network latency becomes too high.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is very important when deploying into cloud systems because the cloud behaves more unpredictably than your own hardware. You want to take this into account when building your system so &lt;a href="http://blog.codeship.com/fast-software-development-workflow/"&gt;your team can be focused on building your product at all times.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://blog.statuspage.io/an-insiders-look-into-incident-management-with-codeships-florian-motlik"&gt;recent interview I did with Statuspage&lt;/a&gt; prompted me to write in more detail about how we respond to incidents. In this post, I&amp;#8217;ll outline our processes, tools, and the document templates we use to make sure we have a repeatable workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downtime Recognition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downtime recognition must always be based on metrics in your system. If downtimes are only recognized when your team or customers see it in the production application a negative impact has already happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure we&amp;#8217;ve got great insights into our infrastructure, we use &lt;a href="https://www.librato.com/"&gt;Librato Metrics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pingdom.com"&gt;Pingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://newrelic.com/"&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt; for collecting various application and server metrics. Every system has various alerts set that trigger Pagerduty incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our on-call hours&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/"&gt;Pagerduty&lt;/a&gt; to manage on-call times and notify our team of any service interruption. We&amp;#8217;re spread out between Vienna and Boston and a few other remote locations, so we can cover almost 24 hours without getting into somebody&amp;#8217;s night time. A person woken up in the middle of the night will not perform at their best during the outage. Plus, it ruins their productivity for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our local coverage times are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Europe: 4 a.m. &amp;#8211; 4 p.m. CEST &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Boston: 10 a.m. &amp;#8211; 10 p.m. EST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.codeship.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Primary-on-call.jpg" alt="Primary on call" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1747" height="396" width="885"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both are reasonable times for each city. In the worst case, somebody might be woken up in the morning in Vienna, though that&amp;#8217;s at a time where we get much less traffic, so service interruptions are less likely. We can cover the whole US workday, from East to West Coast, from Boston so nobody has to be woken up during this most crucial time of the day for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve recently switched to weekly schedules, so you&amp;#8217;re on call for a week in your timezone. Weekends are covered completely by one person, so it&amp;#8217;s rare that you have to be on call on a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure there&amp;#8217;s always somebody covering even if somebody misses a pager call, we&amp;#8217;ve set up a secondary schedule where even non-technical people are on call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our primary versus secondary schedules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary schedule is always comprised of people who can fix our infrastructure; the secondary is made up of most of the rest of the team. This has several advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we share on-call duty between most people in the team. Even if one of the developers doesn&amp;#8217;t see the page, somebody else picks up and can ping other developers and talk to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having only the development team on a schedule would put an unfair burden on the dev team. It would also make it more difficult to resolve the issue and communicate with customers at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this secondary schedule system, we always have somebody we can pull in to take over customer communication. That can mean calling the person on secondary support at night as well if that&amp;#8217;s necessary. It usually isn&amp;#8217;t necessary to pull in the secondary, but it&amp;#8217;s definitely a great fallback to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case a pager call falls through the first and second layer, Jim, our VPE, is on a third layer, and I am on a fourth layer. This makes sure the escalation goes all through the technical team in Codeship if necessary (thankfully it hasn&amp;#8217;t been for a long time). While growing our team, we&amp;#8217;re constantly iterating on our coverage hours to make sure we have great coverage at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downtime Remediation and Follow Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the issue is discovered, the development team will decide who will look into it. Our customer success team will decide who will take over communication for this specific issue and will work with the assigned developer to communicate regularly with our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By defining those two people, we have a clear line of communication between the developers who know the current status of the issue and customer success who can answer support requests and send updates through Twitter or our Statuspage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Steps while fixing the issue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most important step is to update our &lt;a href="http://status.codeship.com"&gt;Statuspage&lt;/a&gt;. We want to make sure we&amp;#8217;re always communicating immediately with our customers if we have a service interruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.codeship.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/StatusPage.jpg" alt="StatusPage" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1748" height="396" width="885"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re always trying to ask ourselves, &amp;#8220;How would we expect important services that we use to communicate with us in a downtime?&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;How can we build more long-term trust through our downtime communication?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way you communicate to your customers during a downtime will decide if they trust you more or less in the future. A single interruption doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily erode trust, but a downtime with bad communication definitely will. Customers expect full transparency when issues are coming up, including a detailed description of what the issue is and how it will be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While fixing the issue, we will regularly update our customers through various channels, and the development team and customer success are in constant contact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#8217;re currently growing our engineering team, we will probably move to a setup where the roles are even more clearly defined. As soon as you have several teams working on different services where downtime might impact several services at once, you need to have a higher level management role in place to manage the downtime effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku released a very interesting post last year about &lt;a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/5/9/incident-response-at-heroku"&gt;their incident response&lt;/a&gt; with the Incident Command System. It&amp;#8217;s definitely an interesting approach that we&amp;#8217;re thinking about for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debriefings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as an issue is fixed, we start work on a debriefing about the service interruption. We&amp;#8217;ve found structured debriefings to be an incredibly helpful tool to get an overview of the whole issue and determine future steps we need to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because we&amp;#8217;re spread out between Europe and the US, compiling this debrief is typically done asynchronously on GitHub with people commenting or committing and pushing changes directly onto the debriefing branch. Meetings or calls are done if necessary, but typically don&amp;#8217;t have to be part of a debriefing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a GitHub repository called Operations that contains our debriefings as well as a template for them. I&amp;#8217;ve copied the template into a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/flomotlik/333ce689db7099911f9e"&gt;GitHub Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template contains an executive summary so anyone can get a quick overview on what happened. We can share this summary internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debriefing template then dives into different aspects of the issue, from detailed technical descriptions to customer communication. We also capture any steps we can take to improve our resolution efforts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure this document accurately reflects what has happened and digs deep while at the same time doesn&amp;#8217;t push blame on anyone. Only when we analyze exactly what happened in our technology and process are we able to improve. But we won&amp;#8217;t be able to dig deep and make sure everyone opens up about their mistakes if we then turn around and immediately use it to punish people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very important lesson we&amp;#8217;ve learned about our template is to leave irrelevant sections of the template empty instead of removing them for a particular debriefing. Removing irrelevant sections makes it difficult to compare debriefings to one another. It can also cause somebody not directly involved with the downtime to wonder if something is missing or getting hidden. Debriefings should be as transparent as possible to maintain your team&amp;#8217;s trust in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debriefings also capture To Dos, so it&amp;#8217;s easy for anyone to follow up and see if we followed through with steps we needed to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These debriefings also form the core data we use to write any public follow-up blog post or any other customer communication we&amp;#8217;re doing after the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By having a well-defined process that goes from detection of an issue to customer communication to solving the issue to debriefing, we can focus all of our energy on resolving an issue once it comes up instead of scrambling to find an ad hoc process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we want this process to be so second nature to everyone that we wrote down a document outlining those steps and hung them up in some of our restrooms. You can download the document &lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6869608/HowtoresolveanIssue.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also include the document as part of our onboarding activities. This ensures that everyone who joins knows exactly how to resolve an issue once they become part of the Pagerduty schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;#8217;re definitely going to change and formalize our process as we grow, we feel we&amp;#8217;ve got the right balance of process and flexibility for the current size of our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know if you have a different process for finding or resolving issues in your system in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;</summary><category term="devops"></category></entry><entry><title>Launching Missiles With Haskell</title><link href="http://ciandcd.github.io/launching-missiles-with-haskell.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-28T01:30:00-04:00</published><author><name>John Cook</name></author><id>tag:ciandcd.github.io,2015-06-28:launching-missiles-with-haskell.html</id><summary type="html">From:&lt;a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/launching-missiles-haskell"&gt;http://java.dzone.com/articles/launching-missiles-haskell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="print-link"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haskell advocates are fond of saying that a Haskell function cannot launch missiles without you knowing it. Pure functions have no side effects, so they can only do what they purport to do. In a language that does not enforce functional purity, calling a function could have arbitrary side effects, including&lt;strong&gt; launching missiles&lt;/strong&gt;. But this cannot happen in Haskell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between pure functional languages and traditional imperative languages is not quite that simple in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming with pure functions is conceptually easy but can be awkward in practice. You could just pass each function the state of the world before the call, and it returns the state of the world after the call. It&amp;#8217;s unrealistic to pass a program&amp;#8217;s entire state as an argument each time, so you&amp;#8217;d like to pass just that state that you need to, and have a convenient way of doing so. You&amp;#8217;d also like the compiler to verify that you&amp;#8217;re only passing around a limited slice of the world. That&amp;#8217;s where &lt;strong&gt;monads&lt;/strong&gt; come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want a function to compute square roots and log its calls. Your square root function would have to take two arguments: the number to find the root of, and the state of the log before the function call. It would also return two arguments: the square root, and the updated log. This is a pain, and it makes function composition difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monads provide a sort of side-band&lt;/strong&gt; for passing state around, things like our function call log. You&amp;#8217;re still passing around the log, but you can do it implicitly using monads. This makes it easier to call and compose two functions that do logging. It also lets the compiler check that you&amp;#8217;re passing around a log but not arbitrary state. A function that updates a log, for example, can effect the state of the log, but it can&amp;#8217;t do anything else. It can&amp;#8217;t launch missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once monads get large and complicated, it&amp;#8217;s hard to know what side effects they hide. &lt;strong&gt;Maybe they can launch missiles after all&lt;/strong&gt;. You can only be sure&amp;#160;by studying the source code. Now how do you know that calling a C function, for example, doesn&amp;#8217;t launch missiles? You study the source code. In that sense Haskell and C aren&amp;#8217;t entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Haskell compiler does give you assurances that a C compiler does not. But ultimately you have to study source code to know what a function does and does not do.&lt;/p&gt;

I hear this almost every day from clients of &lt;a href="http://www.teamed.io"&gt;Teamed.io&lt;/a&gt; and prospects that are planning to become our clients and outsource the software development to us. My best answer is "I don't know; it depends." Sounds like a strange response for someone who claims he knows what he is doing, isn't it? "Here is the 20-page specification that explains all the features of the product; how come you can't estimate the cost?" I can, but I won't. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me ask you something else: &lt;strong&gt;Why do you need an estimate?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I mean it &amp;#8212; why do you ask me how much it will cost to develop the software for you? I can tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you don't trust me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And obviously you have good reasons for that, simply because we both know that a software product is something that can stay in development forever and never be finished. Look at YouTube, for example. How much do you think it would take to create a website like this, where users are able to upload their videos and then stream them? A few days for a good web developer. Will it stream video? Yes, it will. Will it be ready to compete with YouTube? No, it won't. Add a few hundred developers to the team, a few years, and a few million dollars, and even then you will be behind YouTube. Simply because it's a never-ending process. Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, when you ask me how much it will cost to create a system similar to YouTube, according to your specifications, my honest and accurate answer should be: "All of your money, and it won't be enough." Will you sign a contract and outsource the project to me after that answer? No, you won't. That's why I have to lie and promise something like "three months and $40,000". Why would you trust me? If you're smart enough, you won't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that no matter what I promise you, I will be wrong. Terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the solution? What do you do? I totally understand that you do need a number to make your plans and secure the money. You need to choose the right software outsourcing partner, and you need to know what to expect and when, but ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're asking the &lt;strong&gt;wrong question&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question has only one valid answer, and it's the answer nobody will ever give you &amp;#8212; the development will take forever and will consume all your money. All other answers are simply a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry if I've delivered bad news to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's get back to the original problem: Why are you asking me how much it will take to develop the software if you know it's a never-ending process and there is basically no limit? Because you want to make sure your $40,000 will be used the right way and will produce the maximum it can produce. To get this assurance from me, you're asking for an estimate. I'm telling you that your software will be ready for $40K, and you sleep well. Until the moment you realize you've been fooled. By your own self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your concern is perfectly valid. You want to spend no more than $40K, and you want to get a product that will help you achieve your business goals. For example, you want to get into the market and acquire your first few thousand users. In other words, your biggest worry is that your dollars will be turned into the right amount of the right software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any software team can consume your $40K, but each team will produce a different amount of software with different quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that instead of asking how much a software project will cost, you should ask how much software we can create for each dollar you give us and what quality will it be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, don't ask us to estimate how much gas it will take to get to the finish line, because there is no finish line. Instead, ask us how much we charge per gallon and how many gallons we consume per mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different teams use different metrics to measure their results (to be honest, most of them don't use any). We, at &lt;a href="http://www.teamed.io"&gt;Teamed.io&lt;/a&gt;, use &lt;a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html"&gt;hits of code&lt;/a&gt;, bugs, pull requests, test coverage, and a few other metrics as measurable indicators of quantity and quality. We know exactly how much software we can produce for each $100 you pay us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collect those numbers from other teams and compare them. Also, make sure you can control these numbers during the course of the project. That's the guarantee you're looking for. Now you know what you're buying and how much you're paying for it. In other words, like I said above, having these numbers in front of you will assure you that your money is producing the maximum amount of software it can produce, at the highest quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only question left is how you can know you're buying the right software. In other words, you know how much we charge per gallon and how many gallons we use per mile, but how do you know we're driving in the right direction and not making too many circles or detours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one mechanism to guarantee that: regular checkpoints. You should ask us whether we deliver the software in small and regular increments, and whether we allow you to conduct regular &lt;a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html"&gt;independent reviews&lt;/a&gt; of our progress. Also, make sure we prioritize our technical goals, use milestones, versionalize releases, publish release notes, etc. Make sure that in the course of our journey, you are able to control the progress and make corrections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, this is wrong (because there is no "there"):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey driver, how much will it cost to get there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey driver, how much do you charge per mile, and do you have a map?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope I've made my point clear :)&lt;/p&gt;

error 22-Jun-2015 11:09:06  at org.sonar.batch.index.SourceDataFactory.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I could see earlier in the log, that the Cobertura analysis had finished. I could also see that the Cobertura coverage.xml generated ok (this is the file which collates the code coverage info). The next step after creating the coverage.xml file was for the sonar runner to parse it and send a request to Postgres, something had to going wrong at the parsing stage since connecting to Postgres was definitely not an issue (remember everything fine when Cobertura disabled). I knew there was no problem sending the request to Postgres, so thought there must be something odd in the coverage.xml file which meant Sonar runner failed to parse it. As stated, the coverage.xml file details what line number for each class has and hasn't been covered. Sample:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dublintech.blogspot.ie/2015/06/problems-with-cobertura-and-sonar-51.html#" class="toolbar_item command_help help"&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;pre class="xml"&gt;&amp;lt;class name="com.dublintech.me.ApiLogFilters" filename="com/dublintech/me/ApiLogFilters.groovy" line-rate="0.0" branch-rate="0.0" complexity="0.0"&amp;gt;
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;lt;methods&amp;gt;

&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;lt;line number="25" hits="0" branch="false"&amp;gt;

&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;lt;/method&amp;gt;
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;...
&amp;lt;/methods&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/class&amp;gt;
...&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what kind of things could make the parsing barf? What about if there was some odd line number in the coverage.xml file? hmmm... To check this, I ran the following grep:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dublintech.blogspot.ie/2015/06/problems-with-cobertura-and-sonar-51.html#" class="toolbar_item command_help help"&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;&amp;gt; grep "line number" coverage.xml&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gave too much. What about any negative line numbers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;&amp;gt;grep "line number=\"\-" coverage.xml&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;a href="http://dublintech.blogspot.ie/2015/06/problems-with-cobertura-and-sonar-51.html#" class="toolbar_item command_help help"&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nope, none. Ok go back to exception, look at this line:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dublintech.blogspot.ie/2015/06/problems-with-cobertura-and-sonar-51.html#" class="toolbar_item command_help help"&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;hmmm... If a line number was 0, I wonder could it make some array parsing in the sonar runner throw index out of bounds?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dublintech.blogspot.ie/2015/06/problems-with-cobertura-and-sonar-51.html#" class="toolbar_item command_help help"&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;&amp;gt;grep "line number=\"0" coverage.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hit! Time to grep lines before and after and get more info about this file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dublintech.blogspot.ie/2015/06/problems-with-cobertura-and-sonar-51.html#" class="toolbar_item command_help help"&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;&amp;gt;grep -C20 "line number=\"0" coverage.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gave me the culprit. It made no sense to me why Cobertura was saying that linenumber 0 had 0 hits. It was still possible to open the Cobertura html report and view the analysis. Sonar was just barfing when it was parsing it. So I removed this file from Cobertura analysis by adding the following to my build config.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dublintech.blogspot.ie/2015/06/problems-with-cobertura-and-sonar-51.html#" class="toolbar_item command_help help"&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;123456&lt;code&gt;coverage {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;xml = true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;exclusions = [&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;"**/com/dublintech/me/MyOddFile*"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then re-ran and hey presto, everything working. The file wasn't in the coverage.xml file. This meant the Sonar runner could parse the file and everything was ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like sonar, I like a stable build and I like rapid feedback so yeah I was a happy person when it was working again!&lt;/p&gt;

What traditional or new tools and technologies are most likely to be important for IT Ops to team more effectively with preproduction teams? What information does IT Ops need to pass right to left and which tools are most likely to aid in that?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is &amp;#8220;A whiteboard marker, a pad of Post-It notes and a couple of pizzas&amp;#8221; :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That answer is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but there is a serious side to it; whilst new tools can be an important part of DevOps (particularly in &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;utomation) you can get started in changing your &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ulture and improving your &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;haring with very simple tools i.e. the aforementioned whiteboard marker, Post-It notes and pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start to break down the silos by getting key people in a room with some blank walls and whiteboards and start sharing information, mapping out your value stream and trying to find out, collaboratively, where the bottlenecks in your existing processes are. Once you&amp;#8217;ve identified your key constraints then fire up Google and start searching for the tools to solve your problems (or visit a site like &lt;a href="http://www.devopsbookmarks.com/"&gt;DevOpsBookmarks&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOpsGuys, like most organisations, have our own &amp;#8220;Opinionated Stack&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; we like the Atlassian Toolset for managing our Agile workflow, TeamCity or Jenkins as our CI tool of choice, Ansible as our configuration management tool for Linux, Powershell DSC for Windows, AppDynamics as our APM tool, Redgate for our Database Lifecycle Management (DLM) and so on. We partner with many of these companies now because we&amp;#8217;ve &amp;#8220;dogfooded&amp;#8221; the products internally and with our customers and they&amp;#8217;ve worked well for our use cases. We always &amp;#8220;try before we buy&amp;#8221; and we &amp;#8220;try before we partner&amp;#8221; too because, as they say, &amp;#8220;your mileage may vary&amp;#8221; (YMMV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes back to fostering a culture of experimentation &amp;#8211; give something a try and see what works for you. We started off using Atlassian HipChat as our chat tool and we really liked it. Then we tried Slack and we liked that one more, so we switched. YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One additional point worth mentioning &amp;#8211; the premise of the question is flawed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#8217;t customers they&amp;#8217;re colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t a silo of &amp;#8220;Us&amp;#8221; (IT Ops=supplier) versus &amp;#8220;Them&amp;#8221; (Everyone Else=customer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are supposed to be breaking down these silos to create cross-functional, multi-disciplinary, product-based teams. Development, Test, IT Security, Networks shouldn&amp;#8217;t be silos any more &amp;#8211; they are people in our team, sitting over the desk from us, attending our daily standups, eating our pizza :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A above is&amp;#160;part of material prepared as our contribution to an CA ebook on &amp;#8220;Agile Operations&amp;#8221;. We wrote our thoughts on 6&amp;#160;questions, of which 4 will be used in the ebook, scheduled to come out in August 2015. We&amp;#8217;ll post the remaining 2 questions with our answers onto the blog over the next 2&amp;#160;weeks.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;

tasks. I recently realized that I really should start to share more often my
workflows and weapons of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I have a hard time enduring while doing Python code reviews, is
people writing utility code that is not directly tied to the core of their
business. This looks to me as wasted time maintaining code that should be
reused from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I'd like to start with
&lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/retrying"&gt;retrying&lt;/a&gt;, a Python package that you
can use to&amp;#8230; retry anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's OK to fail&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Often in computing, you have to deal with external resources. That means
accessing resources you don't control. Resources that can fail, become
flapping, unreachable or unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most applications don't deal with that at all, and explode in flight, leaving a
skeptical user in front of the computer. A lot of software engineers refuse to
deal with failure, and don't bother handling this kind of scenario in their
code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the best case, applications usually handle simply the case where the
external reached system is out of order. They log something, and inform the
user that it should try again later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this cloud computing area, we tend to design software components with
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"&gt;service-oriented architecture&lt;/a&gt;
in mind. That means having a lot of different services talking to each others
over the network. And we all know that networks tend to fail, and distributed
systems too. Writing software with failing being part of normal operation is a
terrific idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retrying&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to help applications with the handling of these potential failures,
you need a plan. Leaving to the user the burden to "try again later" is rarely
a good choice. Therefore, most of the time you want your application to
retry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrying an action is a full strategy on its own, with a lot of options. You
can retry only on certain condition, and with the number of tries based on time
(e.g. every second), based on a number of tentative (e.g. retry 3 times and
abort), based on the problem encountered, or even on all of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of that, I use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rholder/retrying"&gt;retrying&lt;/a&gt;
library that you can retrieve easily on
&lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/retrying"&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;retrying provides a decorator called &lt;code&gt;retry&lt;/code&gt; that you can use on top of any
function or method in Python to make it retry in case of failure. By default,
&lt;code&gt;retry&lt;/code&gt; calls your function endlessly until it returns rather than raising an
error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:python"&gt;import random&lt;br&gt;from retrying import retry&lt;br&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt;@retry&lt;br&gt;def pick_one():&lt;br&gt;    if random.randint(0, 10) != 1:&lt;br&gt;        raise Exception("1 was not picked")&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

This will execute the function &lt;code&gt;pick_one&lt;/code&gt; until &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is returned by
&lt;code&gt;random.randint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;retry&lt;/code&gt; accepts a few arguments, such as the minimum and maximum delays to use,
which also can be randomized. Randomizing delay is a good strategy to avoid
detectable pattern or congestion. But more over, it supports exponential delay,
which can be used to implement
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff"&gt;exponential backoff&lt;/a&gt;, a
good solution for retrying tasks while really avoiding congestion. It's
especially handy for background tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:python"&gt;@retry(wait_exponential_multiplier=1000, wait_exponential_max=10000)&lt;br&gt;def wait_exponential_1000():&lt;br&gt;    print "Wait 2^x * 1000 milliseconds between each retry, up to 10 seconds, then 10 seconds afterwards"&lt;br&gt;    raise Exception("Retry!")&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

You can mix that with a maximum delay, which can give you a good strategy to
retry for a while, and then fail anyway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:python"&gt;# Stop retrying after 30 seconds anyway&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; @retry(wait_exponential_multiplier=1000, wait_exponential_max=10000, stop_max_delay=30000)&lt;br&gt;... def wait_exponential_1000():&lt;br&gt;...     print "Wait 2^x * 1000 milliseconds between each retry, up to 10 seconds, then 10 seconds afterwards"&lt;br&gt;...     raise Exception("Retry!")&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; wait_exponential_1000()&lt;br&gt;Wait 2^x * 1000 milliseconds between each retry, up to 10 seconds, then 10 seconds afterwards&lt;br&gt;Wait 2^x * 1000 milliseconds between each retry, up to 10 seconds, then 10 seconds afterwards&lt;br&gt;Wait 2^x * 1000 milliseconds between each retry, up to 10 seconds, then 10 seconds afterwards&lt;br&gt;Wait 2^x * 1000 milliseconds between each retry, up to 10 seconds, then 10 seconds afterwards&lt;br&gt;Wait 2^x * 1000 milliseconds between each retry, up to 10 seconds, then 10 seconds afterwards&lt;br&gt;Wait 2^x * 1000 milliseconds between each retry, up to 10 seconds, then 10 seconds afterwards&lt;br&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;br&gt;  File "&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;", line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/retrying.py", line 49, in wrapped_f&lt;br&gt;    return Retrying(*dargs, **dkw).call(f, *args, **kw)&lt;br&gt;  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/retrying.py", line 212, in call&lt;br&gt;    raise attempt.get()&lt;br&gt;  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/retrying.py", line 247, in get&lt;br&gt;    six.reraise(self.value[0], self.value[1], self.value[2])&lt;br&gt;  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/retrying.py", line 200, in call&lt;br&gt;    attempt = Attempt(fn(*args, **kwargs), attempt_number, False)&lt;br&gt;  File "&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;", line 4, in wait_exponential_1000&lt;br&gt;  Exception: Retry!
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

A pattern I use very often, is the ability to retry only based on some
exception type. You can specify a function to filter out exception you want to
ignore or the one you want to use to retry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:python"&gt;def retry_on_ioerror(exc):&lt;br&gt;    return isinstance(exc, IOError)&lt;br&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt;@retry(retry_on_exception=retry_on_ioerror)&lt;br&gt;def read_file():&lt;br&gt;    with open("myfile", "r") as f:&lt;br&gt;        return f.read()&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;retry&lt;/code&gt; will call the function passed as &lt;code&gt;retry_on_exception&lt;/code&gt; with the
exception raised as first argument. It's up to the function to then return a
boolean indicating if a retry should be performed or not. In the example above,
this will only retry to read the file if an &lt;code&gt;IOError&lt;/code&gt; occurs; if any other
exception type is raised, no retry will be performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same pattern can be implemented using the keyword argument
&lt;code&gt;retry_on_result&lt;/code&gt;, where you can provide a function that analyses the result
and retry based on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:python"&gt;def retry_if_file_empty(result):&lt;br&gt;    return len(result) &amp;lt;= 0&lt;br&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt;@retry(retry_on_result=retry_if_file_empty)&lt;br&gt;def read_file():&lt;br&gt;    with open("myfile", "r") as f:&lt;br&gt;        return f.read()&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

This example will read the file until it stops being empty. If the file does
not exist, an &lt;code&gt;IOError&lt;/code&gt; is raised, and the default behavior which triggers
retry on all exceptions kicks-in &amp;#8211; the retry is therefore performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it! &lt;code&gt;retry&lt;/code&gt; is really a good and small library that you should leverage
rather than implementing your own half-baked solution!&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written by&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://blog.codeship.com/author/jaroslavholub/" title="Posts by Jaroslav Holub" rel="author"&gt;Jaroslav Holub&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://blog.codeship.com/" target=""&gt;The Codeship Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is all about reducing risk and delivering value faster by producing reliable software in short iterations. &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html"&gt;As Martin Fowler says&lt;/a&gt;, you actually do continuous delivery if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working on new features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any environment on demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containerization of software allows us to further improve on this process. The biggest improvements are in speed and in the level of abstraction used as a cornerstone for further innovations in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;#8217;ll show you how to set up a continuous delivery pipeline using Docker. We&amp;#8217;ll see how using this tool for Linux containers as part of the continuous delivery pipeline lets us nicely encapsulate the build process of a service. It also lets us deploy any revision with a few simple steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tm-tweet-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll mainly use the term continuous delivery in this article, because it stands for the full circle of steps leading to our ultimate goal. However, continuous integration is the most substantial part of continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continuous Integration with Docker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s take a Hello World web server written in &lt;a href="https://golang.org/"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; as an example service. You can find all the code used in this example here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/cd-with-docker-tutorial"&gt;https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/cd-with-docker-tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuous integration setup consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;running unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building the Docker image that we use to build our service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;running the build container and compiling our service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building the Docker image that we run and deploy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pushing the final image to a Docker registry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automated testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running tests in this example is as trivial as it should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:shell"&gt;go test&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building Docker image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of a single service integration is making the end artifact &amp;#8212; Docker image in our case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;#8217;ve deliberately chosen the compiled language Go in this example, we need to build an executable file as part of our integration process. We&amp;#8217;ll eventually place the executable file inside this Docker image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now one might think that we would build our web server executable file using build tools installed on the host dedicated to continuous integration and then somehow copy the binary to the Docker image. But this is a no-no in the containerized world. Let&amp;#8217;s do it all in containers. That way, we won&amp;#8217;t rely on any build tools installed on hosts, and it&amp;#8217;ll make the whole setup easily reproducible and encapsulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building an executable file can be part of a single Docker image build process together with runtime environment setup. Or we can separate the two. Having everything in a single build process, we would end up with extra content (build process leftovers) in our Docker image filesystem, &lt;a href="http://docs.docker.com/introduction/understanding-docker/#how-does-a-docker-image-work"&gt;even if we clean it afterwards&lt;/a&gt; in separate RUN commands within the Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people use tricks to create, manipulate, and remove unwanted stuff in a single &lt;strong&gt;RUN&lt;/strong&gt; command. Although it&amp;#8217;s sometimes handy, I can&amp;#8217;t generally recommend it; in my opinion this adds to Dockerfile complexity. Of course, there are situations where you might want to retain your sources and all in the end artifact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach I recommend, however, is to create separate &amp;#8220;build&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;distribution&amp;#8221; Dockerfiles. Use &lt;strong&gt;Dockerfile.build&lt;/strong&gt; to do the heavy lifting during building the software, and use &lt;strong&gt;Dockerfile.dist&lt;/strong&gt; to create the distributable Docker image, as light and clean as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is &lt;strong&gt;Dockerfile.build&lt;/strong&gt;. As you can see, once we run the build file, we create the container from a golang image, compile our example service, and output the binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:shell"&gt;FROM golang:1.4

RUN mkdir -p /tmp/build 
ADD hello-world.go /tmp/build/ 
WORKDIR /tmp/build 
RUN go build hello-world.go 
CMD tar -czf - hello-world&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Dockerfile.dist&lt;/strong&gt;, we only use this binary and run it on runtime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:shell"&gt;FROM debian:jessie

RUN mkdir /app 
ADD build.tar.gz /app/ 
ENTRYPOINT /app/hello-world&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;strong&gt;build.sh&lt;/strong&gt; script &amp;#8212; the essential part of our continuous integration pipeline &amp;#8212; then looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:shell"&gt;# !/bin/sh
docker build -t hello-world-build -f Dockerfile.build . 
docker run hello-world-build &amp;gt; build.tar.gz 
docker build -t hello-world -f Dockerfile.dist .&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, these three simple Docker commands get us a clean, small &lt;strong&gt;Hello-World&lt;/strong&gt; Docker image that&amp;#8217;s ready to be deployed and run on demand. Once both images used in the &lt;strong&gt;FROM&lt;/strong&gt; clauses are pulled and cached locally, our build process will be a matter of milliseconds or at most a few seconds, with a very small resources footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codeship.com/?utm_source=CodeshipBlog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blogbanner&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Docker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Storing Docker images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once our build process artifact is created, we want to push it to Docker Registry, where it will be available for deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that tagging images properly is very important. &lt;a href="http://container-solutions.com/2015/01/docker-latest-confusion/"&gt;Docker ecosystems suffer&lt;/a&gt; from the usage of &amp;#8220;latest&amp;#8221; tag. If you use a unique tag for every new image, then all your image versions will be easily accessible for deployment in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can choose whether we want to use our own &lt;a href="http://blog.codeship.com/running-secured-docker-registry-2-0/"&gt;Docker Registry&lt;/a&gt; or rely on &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/"&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;. On Docker Hub, you can store public or private repositories of images. It&amp;#8217;s also the first place people would look for your images (if you want anyone to look for them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your own Docker Registry on the other hand gives you full control over your images storage, performance, and security. More advanced setups might combine both approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way you can tag the new image with an appropriate tag and push it to a public hub (replace &lt;strong&gt;your_username&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;your_tag&lt;/strong&gt; with actual values):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:shell"&gt;# !/bin/sh
docker tag hello-world:latest your_username/hello-world:your_tag 
docker push your_username/hello-world:your_tag&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continuously Delivered Containers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have our Docker images building pipeline working and images nicely stashed in a repository, we definitely want to get our service deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you deploy your applications depends on your infrastructure or cloud provider. A few cloud providers support Docker images in their APIs these days (e.g., &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ecs/"&gt;Amazon EC2 Container Service&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/features/one-click-apps/docker/"&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://docs.giantswarm.io/"&gt;Giant Swarm&lt;/a&gt;). You can further leverage the power of containerized applications with resource abstraction tools like &lt;a href="http://mesos.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Mesos&lt;/a&gt; (read more about &lt;a href="http://container-solutions.com/2015/04/how-to-set-up-mesos-on-google-cloud-with-terraform/"&gt;running containers on Mesos&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href="http://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Google Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; that let you deploy and manage containers in their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of our &lt;strong&gt;Hello World&lt;/strong&gt; example, deploying remotely means running the following command remotely on a target machine with Docker installed on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush:shell"&gt;# !/bin/sh
docker stop hello-production 
docker run --rm -p 8000:80 --name hello-production hello-world&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond Continuous Delivery with Docker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using containerized software does not inherently mean one is implementing microservices. However, containers enable this architectural pattern because they encourage developers to split their monoliths based on separation of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microservices also promote communication between containerized components over a plain network using standardized and easily replaceable tubes. To learn more about microservices and why they might be a good architectural pattern for your software project, I recommend &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do"&gt;Building Microservices&lt;/a&gt; by Sam Newman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A continuous delivery pipeline with containerized software also allows you to set up a new kind of testing environment; subsets of (micro)services are deployed in small clusters that represent the system under test running with some parts intentionally disabled or disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creation of such a matrix of deployments and programming against it has little to no additional costs in terms of a continuous integration time. It does have a dramatic impact on the stability and resilience of software in production. Such a testing system allows teams to get ready to deal with any kind of &lt;a href="https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Chaos-Monkey"&gt;Chaos Monkey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Why? Well, DataOps is about making sure data is collected, analyzed,&amp;#160;and available across the company &amp;#8211; i.e. Ops insight for your decision-making systems like Hubspot, Tableau, Salesforce and more. Such systems are key to day-to-day operations and in many cases are as important as keeping your customer facing systems up and running.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If you think about it, today every online business is a data driven business! Everyone is accountable to have up to the minute answers on what is happening across their systems. You can&amp;#8217;t do this reliably without having DataOps in place.&lt;/h2&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;We have seen this trend across our own customer base at &lt;a href="https://logentries.com" target="_blank"&gt;Logentries&lt;/a&gt; where more and more customers using log data to implement &lt;a href="https://blog.logentries.com/2015/04/what-is-dataops-why-you-need-it/"&gt;DataOps across their organization&lt;/a&gt;. Using log data for DataOps allows you to perform the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troubleshoot your systems&lt;/strong&gt; managing your data by identifying errors and correlating data sources&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get notified when one of these systems is experiencing issues via &lt;strong&gt;real time alerts or anomaly detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyze how these systems are used&lt;/strong&gt; by the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logentries has always been great at 1 and 2 above, and this week we have enhanced Logentries to now allow you to perform easier and more powerful analytics with our n&lt;a href="https://logentries.com/logentries-new-analytics-language-makes-the-power-of-log-data-accessible-to-the-masses/" target="_blank"&gt;ew easy-to-use SQL like query language &amp;#8211; Logentries QL (LEQL)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LEQL&amp;#160;is designed to make analyzing your log data dead simple.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are too many log management tools that are built&amp;#160;around complex query languages and require data scientists to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logentries is all about making log data accessible to anyone. With LEQL you are going to be able to use analytical functions like CountUnique, Min, Max, GroupBy, Sort&amp;#8230;A number of our users have already been testing these out via our beta program. One great example is &lt;a href="https://blog.logentries.com/2015/04/dataops-how-pluralsight-uses-tableau-logentries-for-better-analytics/" target="_blank"&gt;how Pluralsight has been using Logentries to manage and understand the usage of their Tableau environment&lt;/a&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Calculating the rate of errors over the the past 24 hours e.g. using LEQL Count function&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Understanding user usage patterns e.g. using GroupBy to understand queries performed grouped by different users&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sorting the data to find the most popular queries and how long they are taking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to answer these types of questions enables&amp;#160;DataOps teams to understand where they need to invest time going forward. For example, do I need to add capacity to improve query performance? Are internal teams having a good user experience or are they getting a lot of errors when they try to access data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Logentries we are all about making the power of log data accessible to everyone and as we do this we are constantly seeing cool new use cases when using logs. If you have some cool use cases do let us know!&lt;/p&gt;

This approach makes sense: According to&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank"&gt;a comScore report&lt;/a&gt;, the number of mobile Internet users outnumbered desktop ones for the first time at some point in late 2013, and has since achieved significant separation. Many companies have responded to this change by implementing bring-your-own-device policies and &lt;a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/products/enterprise-test-management"&gt;building mobile apps&lt;/a&gt; that complement their full websites, mobile Web presence and/or desktop applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch out for pitfalls in mobile apps: General risks and the recent Starbucks example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 However, both BYOD policies and mobile app development require due diligence around cybersecurity if they are to be worthwhile. Safety starts with well-designed applications that are strongly authenticated, do not leak sensitive data and are safe from popular attack vectors like brute-force password guessing. Unfortunately, many apps still have a long way to go on these fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early 2014 study from MetaIntell discovered that 92 percent of the top 500 most popular Android apps at the time&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IlFkOTzivnkJ:https://metaintelli.com/blog/2014/01/22/metaintell-identifies-enterprise-security-risks-privacy-risks-and-data-leakage-in-92-of-top-500-android-mobile-applications/+&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us" target="_blank"&gt;created privacy risks due to data leakage&lt;/a&gt;. Wary of leaky apps as well as what kinds of information users put into them, enterprises have understandably been concerned about the impact of mobile apps on their operations and BYOD initiatives. Security is often the biggest barrier to effective BYOD, and justifiably so considering that&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/08/26/byod-bring-your-own-device/14393635/" target="_blank"&gt;barely more than 40 percent of employees&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;are required to have a security tool installed, according to Webroot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of what could go wrong with today's mobile apps, consider what recently happened to Starbucks. The company's app is a mainstay on many phones, and at one time it accounted for the bulk of all mobile payments made in North America. The issue that arose over the last few months involved unauthorized card reloads and apparent account hijackings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The causes may have been mixed, with&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2484245,00.asp" target="_blank"&gt;poor password management&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;on the part of users possibly exacerbated by exploitation of the app's auto-reload feature and an April 2015 outage of the coffee chain's point-of-sale systems. At the end of the day, Starbucks implemented additional security questions and has been urged to add two-factor authentication into the app to prevent erroneous transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catching mobile app security issues with a test management solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 As we can see, mobile app security is multifactorial, requiring best efforts on the parts of end users, developers and infrastructure/network providers. For enterprises, the best approach to ensuring long-term security is to catch potential vulnerabilities early and often with a test management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A test management solution supports both &lt;a href="https://www.getzephyr.com/insights/when-use-manual-testing-vs-automated-testing"&gt;automated and manual testing&lt;/a&gt;, and receiving updates&amp;#160;in real-time offers you the ability to make important decisions once issues arise. Regardless of how many tests, sprints and projects your company is running, all of them should be conveniently viewed from a lone interface, enabling a single source of truth that keeps your mobile app development initiatives on track.&lt;/p&gt;

This sense is heightened by the number&amp;#160;of endpoints in play that could be vulnerable to threats. Quality assurance teams must ensure that they &lt;a href="https://www.getzephyr.com/insights/top-5-security-threats-software-testers-need-look"&gt;have the data on hand&lt;/a&gt; to keep these risks at bay. By gathering information on current dangers, companies can better understand the attack surface and establish safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking down elements in play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The attack surface contains all possible vulnerabilities - known and unknown - that may exist across your infrastructure, and sums up your risk of exposure. While the attack surface may seem like one big scary entity, it's actually made up of several parts. Tripwire broke considerations down into&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/understanding-constitutes-attack-surface-2/" target="_blank"&gt;software, network and human attack surfaces&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;to make this large picture easier to manage. QA professionals should approach the attack surface this way in order to ensure that all aspects are accommodated for rather than being overwhelmed by the big picture. Everything from coding to devices and human error must be considered when gathering information and preparing for potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyze data and act on it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Testing results can be a critical indicator of what types of vulnerabilities may be present within a program. The Open Web Application Security Project&amp;#160;noted that an attack surface analysis will help QA and developers&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet" target="_blank"&gt;better understand what they're up against&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and build in security accordingly. During this evaluation, they must determine high risk areas of code, what functions should be reviewed for defects and when the attack surface has changed. This last consideration will be especially critical as further tests and adjustments will be needed to secure the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything that an organization does could affect the attack surface, which means that it will have to be constantly monitored. QA teams need to ask what's changed, how it's different from before and what potential holes were opened in the process. This will help keep the attack surface visibly mapped out, making it easy to strategize how to protect the business, its employees and customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce the noise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 While a breach is certainly possible, that doesn't mean it should be easy for attackers to gain entry into business systems. Organizations can reduce their attack surface by decreasing the amount of noise within their infrastructure. Accuvant pointed out that doing this will&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.accuvant.com/blog/how-to-reduce-attack-surface" target="_blank"&gt;reduce an attack's operating surface&lt;/a&gt;, minimizing the likelihood of malicious access. QA teams can use tactics like configuration management, exploit analysis, patching, sandboxing and secure application development to effectively reduce or eliminate the impact of a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Integrating these strategies into your security program make it much harder for exploits to attack your organization's systems," Accuvant stated. "By reducing your adversaries' operating surface, you are effectively limiting their attack surface."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat of a vulnerability is a very real concern for businesses. By gathering information on what types of attacks are becoming prevalent and understanding how they can affect company software, QA teams can prepare for these risks and protect their users from the growing attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Reducing Risk Through Security Qa Automation</title><link href="http://ciandcd.github.io/reducing-risk-through-security-qa-automation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-20T01:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>itech001</name></author><id>tag:ciandcd.github.io,2015-06-20:reducing-risk-through-security-qa-automation.html</id><summary type="html">from:http://java.dzone.com/articles/reducing-risk-through-security&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="print-link"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations are under constant pressure to protect their critical assets from cyberattacks that have plagued a wide variety of industries. However, there is currently no set method of how to ensure that company applications will be safe from these threats. &lt;a href="https://www.getzephyr.com/insights/how-empower-your-quality-assurance-teams"&gt;Quality assurance&lt;/a&gt; teams have implemented a wide range of approaches to ensure security, but manually executing all of these cases can be time-consuming and lead to potential vulnerabilities. For this reason, QA should look into security automation to reduce risks and &lt;a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/products/enterprise-test-management"&gt;improve overall program capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have realistic expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 When building security into the software development life cycle, there are numerous benefits businesses can see, including seamless protection integration and awareness of team members. An AT&amp;amp;T white paper noted that automated vulnerability scanning can be a great first step for QA teams to implement as it can easily and&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.business.att.com/content/whitepaper/Integrated_Security_QC_wp.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;quickly identify commonly occurring issues&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, however, it's not foolproof, since it cannot detect more sophisticated defects like authentication issues or business logic vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, security QA automation can be a major asset to development efforts and can reduce overall risk, but will still require other tools like manual testing to fully evaluate the threat landscape. After the app has been released, automation can often be essential for finding threats, while enabling QA teams to focus on current projects that are still underway. This helps lower the potential risk across the board while still ensuring that each program gets the attention it needs, no matter where it is in its life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools for the job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 There are a number of resources that QA teams can utilize to test the security of their projects. TechTarget contributor Michael Cobb noted that automated QA verification is often&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/Which-automated-quality-assurance-tools-can-be-used-to-test-software" target="_blank"&gt;executed through code analysis and vulnerability testing&lt;/a&gt;. Both of these assets can quickly find errors that may be easily missed during manual evaluations. This alone helps significantly reduce risks to app functionality and security capabilities while ensuring that QA teams are eliminating common vulnerabilities. These tools paired with human testers can effectively find issues and better protect their projects for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Despite advances in computer automation, humans are still superior at ensuring applications are developed securely, probably because the best challenge is posed by humans, notably those who can think as an attacker would," Cobb wrote. "However, human work is often more effective if a framework guides it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relying on QA for better security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Even if QA teams leverage automated tools for security needs, they must still have an understanding of how these tests work and be able to execute them. Chiron Professional Journal noted that while QA professionals may not often be security experts,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.chiron-solutions.com/chiron-professional-journal/2011/04/06/how-qa-teams-can-find-and-remediate-security-vulnerabilities-earlier-in-the-development-process-reducing-downstream-cost-and-corporate-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;having the tools on hand&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;can help them perform the necessary processes and mitigate critical risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Let's be clear here &amp;#8211; we're not expecting a QA analyst to be able to cobble together a complicated script to evade an anti-cross-site scripting library &amp;#8230;&amp;#160;but we should reasonably expect that the analyst can either effectively use a tool, or follow a well-documented process that has varying tests and permutations allowing the analyst to think for themselves and flag questionable results for review by the security experts," the Chiron Professional Journal stated.&lt;/p&gt;

Through exploring continuous integration, we will cover how we can overcome these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we will take a look at the source of the problem, which lies in the software development cycle. Next, we will cover some of the change conflicts that can take place during that process, and finally we will explore the main factors that can make these problems escalate, followed by an explanation of how continuous integration solves these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Source of the Problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at what a traditional software development cycle looks like. Each developer gets a copy of the code from the central repository. The starting point is usually the latest stable version of the application. All developers begin at the same starting point, and work on adding a new feature or fixing a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each developer makes progress by working on their own or in a team. They add or change classes, methods and functions, shaping the code to meet their needs, and eventually they complete the task they were assigned to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the other developers and teams continue working on their own tasks, changing the code or adding new code, solving the problems they have been assigned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we take a step back and look at the big picture, i.e. the entire project, we can see that all developers working on a project are changing the context for the other developers as they are working on the source code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As teams finish their tasks, they copy their code to the central repository. There are two scenarios that can take place at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The code in the central repository is unchanged&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code is the same as the initial copy. If this is the case, things are simple, because the system is unchanged. All the ideas we had about the system still stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is always the case if you are the only developer working on the application and if you have finished your work before the other members of your team. Either way, things are looking good for you. The system you have created and tested can be delivered to users without additional changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The code in the central repository has changed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second scenario is that the application you have been working on has changed, and you discover this at the point when you try to copy your code over to the central repository. Changes in the code may or may not be in conflict with the ones you've made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there are conflicts, you need to resolve them in order to be able to successfully deliver your code to the users. In this case, things could get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we'll explore the types of conflicts that can happen and what you may need to do to resolve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Change Conflicts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several types of change conflicts that can occur when integrating code. Here are some of the most common ones. We'll start with the simplest scenarios, and gradually explore the more complex ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The implementation details have changed&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;- You refactored a method, but so did the developer that has already integrated their code into the central repository. The behavior of the method is the same in all three implementations. You will need to pick the version that will stay, and remove the other implementations. You can even come up with a fourth implementation. This is a simple type of conflict, which you can usually resolve within a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The APIs you have been relying on have changed&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;- For instance, the behavior of a certain method has changed. This could affect your code in a number of ways &amp;#8212; from minor changes that you might need to make, to major structural changes. There is no silver bullet in such cases. You will need to carefully study the changes and make all the fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An entire subsystem of the application behaves in a different way&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;- in such cases you will almost certainly be facing a partial, if not a full rewrite of your solution. If this is the case, you will probably need to speak with all the developers working on the application, because such a significant change should not happen without letting the rest of the team know about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These and a number of other issues could come up, caused by various factors. Different versions of frameworks, libraries, databases are another potential source of conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have updated your code so it can be compiled or interpreted, you also need to remember to repeat all the tests that you have previously ran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These examples show that the amount of work needed to solve a problem that was initially assigned to a developer can easily double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://d2l3jyjp24noqc.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/img/21/integration-traditional.png" alt="Traditional Integration" height="417" width="563"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Escalating Factors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the main factors that can make these problems escalate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The size of the team working on the project.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;The number of changes that are being pushed back into the main repository is proportional to the number of people on the project. This makes the process of integrating code into the main repository significantly harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The amount of time passed since the developer got the latest version of the code from the central repository.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;As time passes, other people working on the same project are integrating more and more of their work, and changing the context in which your code needs to run. Sometimes the changes in the main repository are so big that it's easier to do a complete rewrite of your solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large number of changes in the system make integration events more complex and can have a huge effect on the productivity of the team. Such situations are even referred to as "integration hell".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process has a number of other negative consequences for your business. Testing and fixing bugs can take forever. Your releases are running late. Teams are stressed out because of long and unpredictable release cycles, and morale deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution: Integrate Continuously&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution to the problem of managing a large number of changes in big integration events is conceptually simple. We need to split these big integration events into much smaller integration events. This way, developers need to deal with a much smaller number of changes, which are easier to understand and manage. To keep integration events small and easily manageable, we need them to happen often. A couple of times a day is ideal. The practice of doing small integrations often is called&amp;#160;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple, but at the same time it often appears to be impossible to implement in practice. This is because changing the process requires us to change some of our own habits, and changing habits is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://d2l3jyjp24noqc.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/img/22/integration-continuous.png" alt="Continuous Integration" height="417" width="563"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Practice of Continuous Integration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid the previously described issues, developers need to integrate their partially complete work back into the main repository on a daily basis, or even a couple of times a day. To accomplish this, they first need to pull in all the changes added to the main repository while they were working on the code. They also must make sure that their code will work once it is integrated into the main repository. The only way to ensure this is to test every feature of the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What first comes into mind when we start considering continuous integration is that the developers would need to spend half of their time every day testing the code in order not to break the code in the main repository for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why the prerequisite for continuous integration is having an automated test suite. Automated tests take away the burden of the manual, repetitive, and error-prone testing process from the developers. They also make the entire testing process much quicker. A computer can replace hours of manual testing with just minutes of automated testing.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/behavior-driven-development"&gt;Behavior-driven&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and test-driven development are techniques that help developers write clean, maintainable code while writing tests at the same time. Testing techniques are out of the scope of this article, and you can read more about them in&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials"&gt;other articles on Semaphore Community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests make sense only if they are executed every time the source code changes, without exception. A continuous integration service&amp;#160;such as Semaphore CI is a tool which can automate this process by monitoring the central code repository and running tests on every change in the source code. Apart from running tests, they also collect test results and communicate those results to the entire team working on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of continuous integration is so important that many teams have a rule to stop working on their current task if the version in the central repository is broken. They join the team which is working on fixing the code until tests are passing again. The role of a continuous integration service is to improve the communication between developers by communicating the status of a project's source code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Adopt Continuous Integration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous integration as a practice makes a big contribution to improving the development process, but also calls for essential changes in the everyday development routine. Adopting it comes with challenges that are easy to overcome if the process is introduced gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges teams face is the lack of an automated testing suite. A good recipe for overcoming this situation is to start adding automated tests for all new features as they are being developed. At the same time, the developer working on a bug fix should also work to cover the related code with tests. Whenever a bug is reported, the team should first write a failing test to demonstrate the existence of bug. Once the fix is created, the tests should pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the automated tests suite gradually becomes more comprehensive, and the developers begin relying on it more and more. Adopting a continuous integration service to communicate the status of the tests to the entire team in the early stages of a project is also important, because it raises awareness of the project status among team members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing continuous integration and automated testing into the development process changes the way software is developed from the ground up. It requires effort from all team members, and a cultural shift in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big changes in the workflow are not easy to pull off quickly. Changes have to be introduced gradually, and all team members and stakeholders need to be on board with the idea. Educating team members about the practice of continuous integration practice and building the automated tests suite needs to be done systematically. Once the first steps have been taken, the process usually continues on its own, as both developers and stakeholders begin seeing the benefits of automated testing suites and the peace of mind that this practice brings to the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article originally posted on&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials"&gt;the Semaphore Community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This tool come out of necessity, since we previously lacked support for provisioning connection pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FlexyPool was initially designed for stand-alone environments and the&lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html"&gt;DataSource&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;proxy configuration was done programmatically. Using&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://vladmihalcea.com/2013/12/15/why-i-like-spring-bean-aliasing/"&gt;Spring bean aliases&lt;/a&gt;, we could even substitute an already configured DataSource with the FlexyPool Metrics-aware proxy alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Java EE support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;#8217;ve been asked about supporting Java EE environments and in the true open-source spirit, I accepted the challenge. Supporting a managed environment is tricky because the DataSource is totally decoupled from the application-logic and made available through a&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Naming_and_Directory_Interface"&gt;JNDI&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;lookup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One drawback is that we can&amp;#8217;t use automatic pool sizing strategies, since most Application Servers return a custom DataSource implementation (which is closely integrated with their in-house JTA transaction manager solution), that doesn&amp;#8217;t offer access to reading/writing the connection pool size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the DataSource might not be adjustable, we can at least monitor the connection usage and that&amp;#8217;s enough reason to support Java EE environments too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adding declarative configuration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because we operate in a managed environment, we can no longer configure the DataSource programmatically, so we need to use the declarative configuration support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, FlexyPool looks for the&amp;#160;flexy-pool.properties&amp;#160;file in the current Class-path. The location can be customized using the&amp;#160;flexy.pool.properties.pathSystem property , which can be a:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;URL (e.g.&amp;#160;file:/D:/wrk/vladmihalcea/flexy-pool/flexy-pool-core/target/test-classes/flexy-pool.properties)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;File system path (e.g.&amp;#160;D:\wrk\vladmihalcea\flexy-pool\flexy-pool-core\target\test-classes\flexy-pool.properties)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class-path nested path (e.g.&amp;#160;nested/fp.properties)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The properties file may contain the following configuration options:&lt;/p&gt;Parameter nameDescription&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.data.source.unique.name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each FlexyPool instance requires a unique name so that JMX domains won&amp;#8217;t clash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.data.source.jndi.name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JNDI DataSource location&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.data.source.jndi.lazy.lookup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether to lookup the DataSource lazily (useful when the target DataSource is not available when the FlexyPoolDataSource is instantiated)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.data.source.class.name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DataSource can be instantiated at Runtime using this Class name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.data.source.property.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the DataSource is instantiated at Runtime, each flexy.pool.data.source.property.${java-bean-property} will set the java-bean-property of the newly instantiated DataSource (e.g. flexy.pool.data.source.property.user=sa)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.adapter.factory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifies the PoolAdaptorFactory, in case the DataSource supports dynamic sizing. By default it uses the generic DataSourcePoolAdapter which doesn&amp;#8217;t support auto-scaling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.metrics.factory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifies the MetricsFactory used for creating Metrics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.metrics.reporter.log.millis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifies the metrics log reported interval&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.metrics.reporter.jmx.enable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifies if the jmx reporting should be enabled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.metrics.reporter.jmx.auto.start&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifies if the jmx service should be auto-started (set this to true in Java EE environments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexy.pool.strategies.factory.resolver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifies a ConnectionAcquiringStrategyFactoryResolver class to be used for obtaining a list of ConnectionAcquiringStrategyFactory objects. This should be set only if the PoolAdaptor supports accessing the DataSource pool size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hibernate ConnectionProvider&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Java EE applications already use&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API"&gt;JPA&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and for those who happen to be using Hibernate, we can make use of the&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.3/manual/en-US/html/ch03.html#configuration-jdbc-properties"&gt;hibernate.connection.provider_class&lt;/a&gt;configuration property for injecting our proxy DataSource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hibernate provides many built-in extension points and the connection management is totally configurable. By providing a custom&lt;a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.3/javadocs/org/hibernate/engine/jdbc/connections/spi/ConnectionProvider.html"&gt;ConnectionProvider&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;we can substitute the original DataSource with the FlexyPool proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All we have to do is adding the following property to our&amp;#160;persistence.xml&amp;#160;file:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="xml"&gt;&amp;lt;property name="hibernate.connection.provider_class"
          value="com.vladmihalcea.flexypool.adaptor.FlexyPoolHibernateConnectionProvider"/&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, this provider will configure a FlexyPoolDataSource and use it whenever a new connection is requested:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="java"&gt;private FlexyPoolDataSource&amp;lt;DataSource&amp;gt; flexyPoolDataSource;
 
@Override
public void configure(Map props) {
    super.configure(props);

    &amp;lt;/persistence-unit&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/persistence&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in a production Java EE environment we use an Application server specific DataSource configuration, for simplicity sake, I&amp;#8217;m going to configure the FlexyPooldataSource using the&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/annotation/sql/DataSourceDefinition.html"&gt;DataSourceDefinition&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;annotation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="java"&gt;@DataSourceDefinition(
    name = "java:global/jdbc/flexypool",
    className = "com.vladmihalcea.flexypool.FlexyPoolDataSource")
@Stateless
public class FlexyPoolDataSourceConfiguration {}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now need to pass the actual DataSource properties to FlexyPool and this is done through the flexy-pool.properties configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;flexy.pool.data.source.unique.name=unique-name
flexy.pool.data.source.class.name=org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDataSource
flexy.pool.data.source.property.user=sa
flexy.pool.data.source.property.password=
flexy.pool.data.source.property.url=jdbc:hsqldb:mem:test
flexy.pool.metrics.reporter.jmx.auto.start=true&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual DataSource is going to be created by the FlexyPoolDataSource on start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Locating the actual DataSource from JNDI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the actual DataSource is already configured by the Application Server, we can instruct FlexyPool to fetch it from JNDI. Let&amp;#8217;s say we have the following DataSource configuration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="java"&gt;@DataSourceDefinition(
    name = "java:global/jdbc/default",
    className = "org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDataSource",
    url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:test",
    initialPoolSize = 3,
    maxPoolSize = 5
)
@Stateless
public class DefaultDataSourceConfiguration {}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;To proxy the JNDI DataSource, we need to configure FlexyPool like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;flexy.pool.data.source.unique.name=unique-name
flexy.pool.data.source.jndi.name=java:global/jdbc/default
flexy.pool.metrics.reporter.jmx.auto.start=true&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlexyPoolDataSource is defined alongside the actual DataSource:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="java"&gt;@DataSourceDefinition(
    name = "java:global/jdbc/flexypool",
    className = "com.vladmihalcea.flexypool.FlexyPoolDataSource")
@Stateless
public class FlexyPoolDataSourceConfiguration {}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPA will have to fetch the FlexyPoolDataSource instead of the actual one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="xml"&gt;&amp;lt;jta-data-source&amp;gt;java:global/jdbc/flexypool&amp;lt;/jta-data-source&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/vladmihalcea/flexy-pool/tree/master/flexy-tomee"&gt;TomEE&lt;/a&gt;, because the DataSourceDefinitions are not lazily instantiated, the actual DataSource might not be available in the JNDI registry when the FlexyPoolDataSource definition is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this, we need to instruct FlexyPool to dely the JNDI lookup until the DataSource is actually requested:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;flexy.pool.data.source.jndi.lazy.lookup=true&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time I used Java EE was in 2008, on a project that was using Java EE 1.4 with EJB 2.1. After 7 years of using Spring exclusively, I&amp;#8217;m pleasantly surprised by the Java EE experience.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://arquillian.org/"&gt;Arquillian&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;is definitely my favourite add-on, since integration testing is of paramount importance in enterprise applications.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://antoniogoncalves.org/2011/09/25/injection-with-cdi-part-iii/"&gt;CDI&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;is both easy and powerful and I&amp;#8217;m glad the dependency injection got standardised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the best asset of the Java EE platform is the community itself. Java EE has very strong community, willing to give you a hand when in need. I&amp;#8217;d like to thank&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/l33tj4v4"&gt;Steve Millidge (Founder of Payara and C2B2)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;for giving me some great tips on designing the FlexyPool Java EE integration,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexsotob"&gt;Alex Soto&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/agoncal"&gt;Antonio Goncalves&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and all the other Java EE members whom I had some very interesting conversations on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since releasing the 2015 State of the Software Supply Chain Report, there has been a lot of great discussion across the industry on best practices for managing the complexity introduced by the volume and velocity of the components used across your software supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I want to focus on the huge ecosystem of open source projects (&amp;#8220;suppliers&amp;#8221;) that feed a steady stream of innovative components into our software supply chains. &amp;#160;In the Java ecosystem alone, there are now over &lt;a href="https://search.maven.org/#stats"&gt;108,000 suppliers&lt;/a&gt; of open source components. &amp;#160;Across all component types available to developers (e.g., RubyGems, NuGet, npm, Bower, PyPI, etc.), estimates now reach over &lt;a href="https://www.openhub.net"&gt;650,000 suppliers&lt;/a&gt; of open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, like in traditional manufacturing, not all suppliers deliver parts of comparable quality and integrity. My latest research, the &lt;a href="http://www.sonatype.com/get-it-now/new-research"&gt;2015 State of the Software Supply Chain Report&lt;/a&gt;, shows that some open source projects use restrictive licenses and vulnerable sub-components, while other projects are far more diligent at updating the overall quality of their components. Choosing the best and fewest suppliers can improve the quality and integrity of the applications we deliver &amp;#160;to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am hosting a &lt;a href="http://go.sonatype.com/ssc-webinar"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt; next week to share many of the detailed report findings, I wanted to share a few of the more meaningful stats here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your 7,600 Suppliers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research for the report revealed many new perspectives on &amp;#8220;suppliers&amp;#8221; across the software supply chains. &amp;#160;First of all, I saw that the average large development organization consumed over 240,000 open source components last year &amp;#8212; sourced from over 7,600 open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, the huge reliance on open source projects is a great thing. &amp;#160;Development teams have chosen to not write those pieces themselves, but have sourced the needed components from outside suppliers. &amp;#160;This practice speeds development, enables more innovation, and ensures time-to-release goals are &amp;#160;achieved. &amp;#160;The use of open source is so prolific today, few of us could ever imagine reducing the use of those &amp;#160;components and their suppliers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time that we benefit from open source, our high paced, high volume consumption practices don&amp;#8217;t allow us the time needed to do the due diligence on the suppliers or open source projects where we source our component parts from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, of the 240,000 average component downloads in 2014, the same businesses sourced an average of 15,000 components that included known security vulnerabilities. &amp;#160;In many cases, developers were downloading vulnerable component versions, when safer versions of those same components were available from the open source projects. While no one intends to download components with known vulnerabilities, the problem is exacerbated due to the lack the visibility into a better recommended version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fewer Suppliers, Less Context Switching&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing an open source project supplier should be considered an important strategic decision in organizations because changing a supplier (&amp;#8220;open source project&amp;#8221;) used &amp;#160;is far more effort than swapping out a specific component. Like traditional suppliers, open source projects have good and bad practices impacting the overall quality of their component parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional manufacturing supply chains intentionally select specific parts from approved suppliers. &amp;#160;They also rely on formalized sourcing and procurement practices. &amp;#160;This practice also focuses the organization on using the best and fewest suppliers &amp;#8212; an effort that improves quality, reduces context switching, and also accelerates mean time to repair when defects are discovered. &amp;#160;One industry example from the report describes how Toyota manages 125 suppliers for their Prius to help sustain competitive advantages over GM who manages over 800 suppliers for the Chevy Volt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, development teams working with software supply chains often rely on an unchecked variety of supply, where each developer or development team can make their own sourcing and procurement decisions. &amp;#160;The effort of managing over 7,600 suppliers introduces a drag on development and is contrary to their need to develop faster as part of agile, continuous delivery and devops practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coming to Terms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you come to terms with the volume of consumption and the massive ecosystem of suppliers you can source your components from, you quickly realize it is impossible to address this issue with a manual review process. &amp;#160;Any organizations clutching to these outdated manual practices are will continue to be outgunned by the velocity by their software supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as traditional manufacturing supply chains have turned to automation, software development teams need to take the same approach by further automating their software supply chains. &amp;#160;Information about suppliers and the quality of their projects needs to be made available to developers at the time they are selecting components. &amp;#160;Information about the latest versions, features, licenses, known vulnerabilities, popularity of versions being used, and the cadence of new releases should be &amp;#160;made available to developers in an automated way. &amp;#160;Automating the availability of this information about suppliers can lead to better and fewer suppliers being used.&lt;/p&gt;

DevOps.com tells the story of Internap&amp;#8217;s DevOps cultural evolution, which grew virally, interwoven with the company&amp;#8217;s development of PrivateStack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges in Internap&amp;#8217;s Common Development Environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges that slowed Internap&amp;#8217;s cloud development process triggered a hunger for change and for a new / altered development scheme. &amp;#8220;The Internap public cloud product is essentially composed of micro services that make cloud resources available to our customers,&amp;#8221; says Mathieu Mitchell, Senior Software Developer, Internap. Internap engineering teams tested their cloud services simultaneously with each affecting the other and transferring adverse effects to production or pre-production. Internap needed to let the billing team test their services, integrated with a duplicate of the production software and environment, without affecting the virtualization team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These challenges were rooted in a commonly shared development environment for all the engineering teams and team members, which introduced tedium for engineers as they worked to build and deploy stable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sharing a common development environment, each engineer&amp;#8217;s tests depended on environment consistency and reliability. When engineers / developers tested two changes at the same time, there was no way to tell which change introduced a regression. The most reasonable way to address this prior to PrivateStack was to push all changes into the environment and dedicate specific engineers to identify and fix the issues that occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge with dedicating specific engineers to troubleshoot these regressions was that they had a diminished context to work with when compared to the original developer&amp;#8217;s understanding. The team that introduced a change needed feedback from the environment and to shoulder responsibility for fixing the issue. This would result in a stable codebase and the ability to write more thorough, automated tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is why we created PrivateStack&amp;#8211;to allow us to independently test a single change, integrated with other services, in an environment that is the equivalent of a private production setup,&amp;#8221; says Mitchell. PrivateStack enables development teams to innovate while ensuring that changes behave correctly in production. This in turn enables CD and speeds development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOps Culture Leads Teams to Success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Internap developed PrivateStack, engineering observed a DevOps belief system spreading across the project and the teams. &amp;#8220;At first, it was only a minority among us, mostly people with an Agile background, who advocated the Continuous Delivery approach while we worked on this project. We really believe in delivering value to our customers as quickly as possible. To achieve Continuous Delivery, we needed people to understand that automating everything was the way to go,&amp;#8221; says Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more engineers realized that they were the solution, they became increasingly motivated to enhance processes, create the new development environment, and use CD to develop the Internap public cloud product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results with PrivateStack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PrivateStack enables Internap teams to share the same code and system configurations while individual developers have each their own private production environment to test their software without affecting others. &amp;#8220;We heavily leverage virtualization to be able to recreate our environments, since buying racks and racks of hardware to make this available to all of our developers would be cost prohibitive,&amp;#8221; says Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With PrivateStack, Internap isolates production issues during development, keeping R&amp;amp;D efficient and slashing pre-production troubleshooting time. &amp;#8220;PrivateStack also improves our time-to-market, is much less costly, and most importantly, reduces the chance of any issues reaching the customer,&amp;#8221; says Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOps Culture Wrap Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish the PrivateStack project and foster a DevOps culture at the same time, Internap&amp;#8217;s internal core of CD true believers lead by example. Mitchell and his colleagues adhered to consistent principles while hearing out other team members on their concerns. This helped them to encourage the larger engineering department including billing and virtualization teams to adopt a DevOps and CD frame of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We dedicated two people to drive this initiative, along with a few others who believed in the Continuous Delivery approach but were not involved directly,&amp;#8221; says Mitchell. That was enough to get the job done. Now the vast majority of the engineering department is targeting CD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We are eager to share our PrivateStack platform with the open source community to enable other developers to run production-like environments for development in their day-to-day operations,&amp;#8221; says Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;

While I see this is a growing general trend (&lt;a href="http://packet.net"&gt;Packet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.internap.com/bare-metal/bare-metal-cloud/"&gt;Internap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.rackspace.com/en-us/cloud/servers/onmetal"&gt;RackSpace&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic"&gt;OpenStack Ironic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://maas.ubuntu.com/"&gt;MaaS&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;#8217;m going to stay firmly within &lt;a href="http://rackn.com"&gt;my wheelhouse&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href="http://github.com/opencrowbar/core"&gt;OpenCrowbar&lt;/a&gt; as my reference here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the API-driven metal features of OpenCrowbar, this has translated into two paths for workloads to run on metal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;b&gt;&amp;#8220;Cloudify&amp;#8221; the metal using APIs&lt;/b&gt; from tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/chef/chef-provisioning"&gt;Chef Provision&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/install/index.html"&gt;SaltStack Libcloud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/docker/machine"&gt;Docker Machine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh"&gt;Cloud Foundry BOSH&lt;/a&gt;. These tools have clients that target cloud APIs like OpenStack and Amazon. These same clients work against cloud are easily ported to Crowbar&amp;#8217;s APIs. &amp;#160;Five years ago, conventional wisdom was that we&amp;#8217;d need a universal cloud API; however, practice has shown it&amp;#8217;s not very difficult to wrap APIs in a way that does not reduce every cloud to a least common denominator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;b&gt;DevOps deploy the workload&lt;/b&gt; using hand-offs to tools like Chef, Saltstack, Puppet or Ansible. This approach leverages the community scripts (Cookbooks, Modules, Playbooks) for the workload with the critical ability to create a tuned environment and inject the needed parameters directly into the scripts. &amp;#160;A critical lesson we learned going from Crowbar v1 to v2 was for our scripts to have crisp attribute input/output boundary to avoid embedding environmental knowledge into the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#8217;m casting this in Crowbar terms, I see this approach to metal as coming into the market by force fuels by a desire for containers-on-metal and devops-on-metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s look at some of the unique and shared use-cases for each approach:&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metal API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Both&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metal Cluster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy Cloud to Metal Migration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal Tool Customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portability of DevOps Scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take advantage of power cycling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables constant refresh cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage Hardware features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Network topologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In either case, you have to handle bespoke (hipster word for custom) steps in the provisioning flow that are unique to the your operational needs. Our experience is that each site (even each server!) is unique in some incremental way. &amp;#160;For example, one site may require teamed networks with VLANs while another requires flat networks with an SDN layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These differences are not mistakes or errors&lt;/strong&gt;: the reality of physical ops and individual operational choices mean that there are a lot of valid configurations. Rather than attempt the Sisyphean task of enforced conformity, we work to abstract differences so that they can be ignored when they are not material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the choices are &lt;b&gt;not &lt;/b&gt;mutually exclusive. Metal APIs are often faster but harder to optimize. You can use them to get started quickly and then invest time to optimize a cluster for long term operations. &lt;b&gt;The underlying physical orchestration can support both.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you looking at getting closer to metal? &amp;#160;Which of the options above makes the most sense to you? &amp;#160;I&amp;#8217;d love to hear about your use-cases, architecture and configuration requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

With 285 respondents representing a wide range of organizations, it shows that Containers will be part of many production environments in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, only 38 percent of respondents reported using containers in production environments, but that number is projected to increase 69 percent over the next 12 months as organizations find new ways to address important barriers to adoption. It verified that Docker is overwhelmingly the container of choice, with 92% of respondents having used or investigated it, followed by LXC (32%) a distant second, but still far ahead of Rocket (21%). To access the complete survey and report visit&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://clusterhq.com/assets/pdfs/state-of-container-usage-june-2015.pdf"&gt;https://clusterhq.com/assets/pdfs/state-of-container-usage-june-2015.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies ranging in size from small organizations with 1 to 500 employees (69%), to mid-size companies with 501-2,500 personnel (12%), all the way up to large enterprises with over 2,500 employees (19%) are represented in the survey. This demonstrates that containers are being embraced by all businesses from the startup stage to Fortune 500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents came predominantly from Development, Operations and DevOps teams. QA and security teams were a smaller share. The survey revealed how container technologies are being used today, as well as research-based insights while providing clues as to where the industry is trending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the ClusterHQ release on the survey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey also revealed insights into what is perceived to be the primary barriers to container adoption. Security seems to be emerging as a consistent concern throughout the DevOps community in these times of never ending breaches throughout the world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security &amp;#8212; 61%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Management &amp;#8212; 53%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking &amp;#8212; 51%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skills and Knowledge &amp;#8212; 48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent Storage &amp;#8212; 48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Management capabilities also emerged as essential to the success of container strategies and that the vast majority of organizations want to run databases as well as additional services in containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When asked to rate how important data management&amp;#160;is to container strategies, 66 percent reported it as a critical or&amp;#160;important gating factor, 29 percent ranked it as moderately important and&amp;#160;only 5 percent reported that it carries no importance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 70% of respondents said they would like to&amp;#160;run a database or other stateful service in their container&amp;#160;environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respondents were also asked which specific features of&amp;#160;container data management they considered to be most important, selecting&amp;#160;the &amp;#8220;integration of data management capabilities into existing container&amp;#160;workflows and tools&amp;#8221; as their first choice, with &amp;#8220;seamless&amp;#160;movement of data between dev, test and production environments&amp;#8221; a&amp;#160;close second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL (53%), Redis (52%), PostgreSQL (50%), and&amp;#160;Elasticsearch (43%) were reported as the top four most frequently used&amp;#160;stateful services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers have become known for portability and flexibility, the survey reveals that organizations are using them in different infrastructures but most frequently in on-premises data centers (57%), followed by Amazon Web Services (52%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think it is safe to say Containers are rapidly becoming one of the staples of development and are here to stay to stay in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week the DevOpsGuys headed up to Newport&amp;#8217;s Celtic Manor to take part in Digital 2015 &amp;#8211; the Welsh Government&amp;#8217;s initiative to bring digital innovators and business professionals together. The 2-day event saw more than 2,000 delegates and 140 speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOpsGuy co-founder Steve Thair says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;These initiatives are invaluable to the digital sector because they expose the wide variety of digital and technological services that are available in South Wales to business professionals who can use them to take online business services to the next level. It&amp;#8217;s a relaxed environment where people can chat and form connections that will have a direct impact on the future of business and technology in Wales.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diverse range of speakers at the event included Microsoft, the WRU, Amazon and the DVLA. The opportunity to discuss the needs of businesses directly with those running them is invaluable. This dialogue can lead to collaborative projects and further development of the burgeoning tech industry in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team are excited to see more events like this one springing up in the near future. Look out for us at the up-coming Agile Cymru in the Wales Millennium Centre on the 7th and 8th of July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, aching, tired and happy the DOGs returned from &lt;a href="http://www.trekfest.org.uk/"&gt;TrekFest 2015&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;in the Welsh mountains having raised &amp;#163;1,143.00 for the Countess Mountbatten Hospice and SSNAP &amp;#8211; two charities close to the heart of the team. That&amp;#8217;s 114% of our initial target, so a huge thank you to everyone who donated so generously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather could not have been better for a long, scenic ramble in one of the UKs most beautiful spots; beautifully sunny with a refreshing breeze kept the team going.

Some companies pay, some companies develop home grown solutions, some live with the version which are getting older every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem #2:&amp;#160; When multiple open source projects once consumed by your product can bring in different versions of the same library. One never knows which will be picked up at run-time and behavior on the developer&amp;#8217;s box based on the Murphy&amp;#8217;s Law will be different from the server run-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not have to be such an ordeal.&amp;#160; With the power of maven plugins this can be solved relatively easy. &lt;a href="http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/"&gt;Versions Maven Plugin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/maven-enforcer-plugin/"&gt;Maven Enforcer Plugin&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Versions Maven Plugin will keep versions up-to-date and as you probably guessed from the name Maven Enforcer plugin will be guarding against multiple versions of the maven artifact in the build package produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s see how one introduced enforcer into the mix first. The code below can go in the parent pom.xml of the project, or global parent of the projects if one exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="as3"&gt;&amp;lt;project &amp;#8230;&amp;gt;
&amp;#8230;
&amp;lt;plugins&amp;gt;
&amp;#8230;
&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;maven-enforcer-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;1.4&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;enforce-versions&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;enforce&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;rules&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;requireMavenVersion&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;[2.2.*,)&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;/requireMavenVersion&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;requireJavaVersion&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;[1.7.*,)&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;/requireJavaVersion&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;DependencyConvergence/&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/rules&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;
&amp;#8230;
&amp;lt;/plugins&amp;gt;
&amp;#8230;
&amp;lt;/project&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each dependency version collision one has to pick the version to keep and exclude the ones that are mismatched. See maven &lt;a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-optional-and-excludes-dependencies.html"&gt;help page&lt;/a&gt; for details. If one wants absolute guarantee of the version used, this is the only way to go. An example of excluded dependencies will be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="as3"&gt;&amp;lt;project &amp;#8230;&amp;gt;
&amp;#8230;
	&amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt;
&amp;#8230;
		&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;com.lordofthejars&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;nosqlunit-mongodb&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${nosqlunit.veresion}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;test&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;exclusions&amp;gt;
	      	&amp;lt;exclusion&amp;gt;
	      		&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.slf4j&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
	      		&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;slf4j-api&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
	      	&amp;lt;/exclusion&amp;gt;
	      	&amp;lt;exclusion&amp;gt;
	      		&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;com.github.fakemongo&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
	      		&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;fongo&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
	      	&amp;lt;/exclusion&amp;gt;
	      	&amp;lt;exclusion&amp;gt;
	      		&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.mongodb&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
	      		&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;mongo-java-driver&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
	      	&amp;lt;/exclusion&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;/exclusions&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
&amp;#8230;
	&amp;lt;/dependencies&amp;gt;
&amp;#8230;
&amp;lt;/project&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;b&gt;open source developer side&lt;/b&gt;, producing two flavors of the package for consumption with and without dependencies can make world a better place. This is the difference of maven scope &amp;#8216;provided&amp;#8217; vs. default scope &amp;#8216;compile&amp;#8217;. &lt;a href="https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/"&gt;Apache Maven Shade Plugin&lt;/a&gt; can be used to produce the version with the dependencies to be used there no conflicts can arise along with the version that is artifact version independent and can be used without version conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all conflicts are resolved and one version of each artifact is in the final build product guaranteed, one should check if ones project is up to date. &amp;#160;It is a good practice to do the check at the beginning of the new version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check for outdates dependencies, and plugins, and bring those up to date in the controlled manner (manually) one can execute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;mvn &lt;a href="http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/display-dependency-updates-mojo.html"&gt;versions:display-dependency-updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mvn &lt;a href="http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/display-plugin-updates-mojo.html"&gt;versions:display-plugin-updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mvn &lt;a href="http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/display-property-updates-mojo.html"&gt;versions:display-property-updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As an alternative one can let the plugin update the versions by executing following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;mvn &lt;a href="http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/use-latest-releases-mojo.html"&gt;versions:use-latest-releases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mvn &lt;a href="http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/update-properties-mojo.html"&gt;versions:update-properties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This last mvn command I am going to share is a bonus for the dedicated reader. It allows changing versions across the project and its modules painlessly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;mvn &lt;a href="http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/set-mojo.html"&gt;versions:set&lt;/a&gt; -DgenerateBackupPoms=false&amp;#8203; -DnewVersion=&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Java-client-unable-to-connect-ClusterBlockException-td4019825.html" title="Elasticsearch Users Mailing List"&gt;Issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/18/t/4055" title="Rackspace Community Forums"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://jontai.me/blog/2013/03/elasticsearch-ec2-discovery/" title="How to get Elasticsearch configured in AWS"&gt;Multicast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/discovery-multicast-vs-unicast-td3689223.html" title="Elasticsearch Users &amp;amp;quot;Should I use Multicast or Unicast?&amp;amp;quot;"&gt;networking&lt;/a&gt; aside, &amp;#160;Elasticsearch scales pretty well on its own without the need for any additional overheads, however&amp;#160;discovering whether a node is online or not and connecting only to available nodes can be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaling Logstash can be tricky, but it basically involves &lt;a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/459303/scaling-logstash-with-redis-elasticsearch" title="Advice on scaling Logstash from Stack Overflow"&gt;adding more Logstash servers&lt;/a&gt; to the mix and pointing them at your Elasticsearch cluster by &lt;a href="http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-host" title="Logstash Documentation on adding multiple hosts"&gt;defining multiple hosts&lt;/a&gt; in your Logstash configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kibana (like most web applications) can &lt;a href="http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/_setting_kibana_server_properties.html" title="Kibana Documentation"&gt;only have one Elasticsearch host defined&lt;/a&gt; in the config, so scaling out Kibana is more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above raises the question &amp;#8211; how do I know&amp;#160;which Elasticsearch node to point my configuration at if I don&amp;#8217;t know whether they are there or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer came in the form of &lt;a href="http://consul.io/" title="Consul.io&amp;#x27;s Home Page"&gt;consul.io&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#160;If you&amp;#8217;ve not looked at&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

To help them adopt each of these stages of Database Lifecycle Management (DLM), Redgate Software has launched a new partner program. Redgate Certified Consultants are now being trained in the USA, Europe and Australia &amp;#8211; and many of them will be familiar to SQL Server professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of implementing any stage of DLM are many. Just as with Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), it speeds up the introduction of new features, and makes deployments reliable and error-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though Redgate tools are designed to plug into the tools companies already use for their application d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;evelopment, questions can arise during the implementation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dan Wood of Northwest Cadence says: &amp;#8220;How can we take a system designed to develop, build and deliver applications and make it work with databases as well? It is a question that has plagued a vast majority of the clients I have worked with over the past few years.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, Redgate&amp;#8217;s new partner program is training expert consultants like Dan Wood in DLM &amp;#8211; and giving them the tools and support they need to help clients on-site, or in training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of Certified Consultants is growing and already includes familiar faces like Ike Ellis and Northwest Cadence in the USA, The DevOpsGuys and Skelton Thatcher in the UK, and WARDY IT Solutions in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As John Theron of Redgate points out, the advantages are clear. &amp;#8220;Redgate has spent a lot of time and effort joining the dots in DLM, and making it possible with a suite of dedicated tools, alongside learning materials and resources. The partner program complements this with a group of experts on the ground able to help companies on-site, and provide training in a series of public workshops.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In places as far apart as Washington, London, San Diego, Philadelphia, Northern Ireland, and Baton Rouge, database professionals are how being trained in source control, continuous integration, and automated deployment for the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of the success the training is already achieving can be found in the reaction from database professionals like Jim Dorame. A Database Systems Manager for a large scale educational assessment corporation in the Greater Minneapolis area, he &lt;a href="http://www.jamesdorame.com/index.php/2014/08/22/continuous-integration-for-the-database-is-really-not-that-scary/"&gt;reviewed a continuous integration training day on his blog&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;This tool makes the job of the DBA easier as there will be little doubt that the database is in a consistent and correct state. This alone makes me smile, I cannot tell you how many times I&amp;#8217;ve been executing a release and there was a piece missing that caused a failure.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further information about the training opportunities available can be found on the &lt;a href="http://www.red-gate.com/training/"&gt;Redgate training pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first charity is special since last year, one of our brave team members was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Unfortunately, and with great sadness we know now they are losing their fight &amp;#8211; even after enduring endless rounds of chemotherapy and surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing staff at Countess Mountbatten Hospice are proving specialist&amp;#160;palliative (end of life) care to many fighting a losing battles against advanced stage cancer. They also support their families and loved ones. We&amp;#8217;d love to show our thanks and support by raising money on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s with a tear in our eye and sadness in our hearts, that we chose our second charity to support. Last year, little Ollie lost his fight for his life after being born with a heart defect. He was 4 days old. His parents have displayed so much courage during an immensely difficult time during which the amazing doctors and nurses, support by the SSNAP team provided them with much needed support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is their wish to continue to champion SSNAP, who provide support for the sick newborns and their parents at new born intensive care unit at The John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford as so, we&amp;#8217;ll match whatever we raise through our JustGiving page as a donation to SSNAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These amazing charities are truly special to us here DevOpsGuys.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please support us in raising funds for these brilliant charities who have done so much to support our close friends and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team have signed up to complete the distance in six hours. The trek takes place in the Brecon Beacons and covers the highest peaks in South Wales: Pen y Fan, Corn Du and Fan y Big. The Beacons are a training ground for the SAS so, while the DOGs will have their work cut out for them, they&amp;#8217;re more than up for the challenge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t wait to get out there&amp;#8221; says office manager Rhian Owen. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s such a great opportunity to work together as a team to achieve personal goals and to raise money for good causes &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s going to be brilliant!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve set up a Just Giving page, so you can show your support here. It&amp;#8217;s a chance to donate to some good causes and get the DevOpsGuys and gals out from behind their screens and into the beautiful Welsh wilderness &amp;#8211; come on y&amp;#8217;all, &lt;a href="https://www.justgiving.com/Dev15/?utm_id=8&amp;amp;fb_action_ids=753124678140173&amp;amp;fb_action_types=jgdonation%3Asupport&amp;amp;fb_ref=pfp-share-facebook-test-B-giving&amp;amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;amp;action_object_map=%5B971301802894069%5D&amp;amp;action_type_map=%5B%22jgdonation%3Asupport%22%5D&amp;amp;action_ref_map=%5B%22pfp-share-facebook-test-B-giving%22%5D"&gt;dig deep!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the &amp;#8220;Digital Supply Chain&amp;#8221; is a different way of looking at the SDLC and the Continuous Delivery &amp;#8220;pipeline&amp;#8221; that we feel makes it easier for traditional organisations to understand the criticality of software delivery (and by extension DevOps) in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any organisation that deals with physical goods understands the concept of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain" target="_blank"&gt;supply chain&lt;/a&gt;. They are intimately familiar with ideas like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_management" target="_blank"&gt;supply chain management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_optimization" target="_blank"&gt;supply chain optimisation&lt;/a&gt; and, most importantly, they understand the economics of inventory in the supply chain e.g &lt;a href="http://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/calculate-inventory-carrying-cost" target="_blank"&gt;the carrying cost of inventory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the &amp;#8220;Digital Supply Chain&amp;#8221;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current definitions of the digital supply chain are anchored in the &amp;#8220;New Media&amp;#8221; sector and focus on digital assets like music, video etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;digital supply chain&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; is a &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media"&gt;new media&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; term which encompasses the process of the delivery of digital media, be it music or video, by electronic means, from the point of origin (content provider) to destination (consumer).&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_supply_chain" target="_blank"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia article references above breaks it down into a number of discrete steps as shown in Figure 1 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://devopsguys.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/new-media-digital-supply-chain.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-836" src="https://devopsguys.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/new-media-digital-supply-chain.png?w=474&amp;amp;h=355" alt="image of New Media Digital Supply Chain" width="474" height="355"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we contrast this with our SDLC Continuous Delivery Pipeline (Figure 2) we can see that many of the steps are directly analogous &amp;#8211; we are creating digital assets (code) which we then &amp;#8220;compress&amp;#8221; (i.e. the Build/Integrate process), which we then subject to Quality Control (Test), we store in a Digital Asset Management system (e.g. like Nexus or Artifactory), we tag it with metadata (e.g. what release/version we&amp;#8217;re deploying) and when then deploy it out to servers, CDN&amp;#8217;s, the AppStore or wherever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-837" src="https://devopsguys.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/sdlc-digital-supply-chain.png?w=474&amp;amp;h=355" alt="image of SDLC Digital Supply Chain" width="474" height="355"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your customers grasp the idea that software is a digital asset and that carrying excess inventory and delays in moving these digital assets along the supply chain is costing them money it can be a lightbulb moment for many organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software assets can depreciate over time. Indeed &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://blog.devopsguys.com/2015/01/08/top-5-technical-debt-tips-for-businesses-in-2015/"&gt;technical debt&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; can be looked at as the &amp;#8220;cost of deprecation&amp;#8221; of your software assets over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code that is &amp;#8220;stuck&amp;#8221; in your Digital Supply Chain waiting for your next release (as source code in Git, or as artefacts in an artefact repository) represents a capital investment in &amp;#8220;digital assets&amp;#8221; held as &amp;#8220;digital inventory&amp;#8221; and having it sat on the digital shelf in your digital warehouse is costing you money is analogous to &lt;a href="http://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/calculate-inventory-carrying-cost"&gt;the carrying cost of inventory&lt;/a&gt; for physical inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, the warehousing costs of a digital asset &amp;#8211; your latest idea transformed into software code &amp;#8211; is fairly trivial compared to the costs of physical warehousing BUT the &amp;#8220;&lt;a title="Opportunity Cost Defined" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost" target="_blank"&gt;opportunity cost&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; is very real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each digital software asset represents a significant investment in time &amp;amp; money by your designers, developers, testers, project managers etc and it doesn&amp;#8217;t start generating a return on that investment until it gets to the end of your digital supply chain and into the hands of your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOps then becomes a way to optimise your digital supply chain to ensure that we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only build the right things (reducing waste and optimising our digital inventory),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supplier management (by improving the relationships between Dev, Test, Ops etc we ensure that we are getting the best from all of the &amp;#8220;suppliers&amp;#8221; in our digital supply chain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving our logistics to get our digital assets in the hand of our customers (by automating testing, release and deployment to accelerate the movement of the digital assets from left to right)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly seeking &amp;#8220;flow&amp;#8221; across the supply chain (the 1st way of DevOps!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gathering metrics along the supply chain to give us insight into the bottlenecks (the M in the C.A.L.M.S model)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you&amp;#8217;re talking with people in the business try out the &amp;#8220;Digital Supply Chain&amp;#8221; analogy and see if it works for you &amp;#8211; we&amp;#8217;d love to hear your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DevOpsGuys headed off on a road trip this week to meet with the RedGate team at their amazing offices in Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as working on some workshop training opportunities and guest blog articles (stay tuned to the DevOpsGuys Blog for some RedGate articles coming soon) the teams got together to brainstorm ideas and share skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to look at some of their newest tools and we&amp;#8217;re excited to announce that we will be delivering workshops on RedGate DLM tools at various sessions across the country this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve already implemented these tools for a many of our&amp;#160;customers and we&amp;#8217;re delighted to be able to introduce their qualities, in detail, to a wide range of industry professionals as part of an effective, independent DevOps adoption process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The workshops will be running on:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 20 &amp;#8211; Automated Database Deployment, London&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 26 &amp;#8211;&amp;#160;Automated Database Deployment, Belfast&lt;/p&gt;

Despite that its specification was created more than 50 years ago, COBOL is still running the world&amp;#8217;s most critical business applications. Many of us might not realize how much we rely on COBOL applications in our day-to-day lives. Every time we use an ATM, book an airline ticket, process a check or make an insurance claim, we&amp;#8217;re using a COBOL application to process the transaction, and there&amp;#8217;s a good chance this application is running on System z.&lt;/p&gt;

Diverse, multiple heterogeneous environments are the norm, all of which must be maintained and deployed. Multiple tools and technologies connect, support and create work. Processes are inconsistent, which contributes to difficulties with end-to-end lifecycle governance. Waste, rework and technical debt abound.&lt;br&gt;
At the same time, organizations are striving to be leaner by eliminating tasks that do not add value and by preserving existing IT investments. Woven throughout almost every one of these challenges is the need for speed and innovation while balancing quality and cost. If you have found yourself in this complex, chaotic world, what should you do about it? What improvements should you consider? What practices should you have in place? This paper covers five steps that can help you address today&amp;#8217;s challenges and deliver software that yields better business results.&lt;/p&gt;
